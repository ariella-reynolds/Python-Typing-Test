    "The trouble with writing an Oxford novel is that anyone who has spent time at Oxford will scrutinize your text to determine if your representation of Oxford aligns with their own memories of the place. Worse if you are an American writing about Oxford, for what do Americans know about anything? I offer my defence here:",
    "Babel is a work of speculative fiction and so takes place in a fantastical version of Oxford in the 1830s, whose history was thoroughly altered by silver-work (more on that shortly). Still, I\u2019ve tried to remain as faithful to the historical record on life in early Victorian Oxford as possible, and to introduce falsehoods only when they serve the narrative. For references on early nineteenth-century Oxford, I\u2019ve relied on James J.",
    "Moore\u2019s highly entertaining The Historical Handbook and Guide to Oxford (1878), as well as The History of the University of Oxford volumes VI and VII, edited by M.G. Brock and M.C. Curthoys (1997 and 2000, respectively) among others..",
    "For rhetoric and the general texture of life (such as early nineteenth-century Oxford slang, which differs quite a lot from contemporary Oxford slang),* I have made use of primary sources such as Alex Chalmers\u2019s A History of the Colleges, Halls, and Public Buildings Attached to the University of Oxford, Including the Lives of the Founders (1810), G.V. Cox\u2019s Recollections of Oxford (1868), Thomas Mozley\u2019s Reminiscences: Chiefly of Oriel College and the Oxford Movement (1882), and W. Tuckwell\u2019s Reminiscences of Oxford (1908).",
    "Since fiction can also tell us much about life the way it was lived, or at least the way it was perceived, I have also dropped in details from novels such as Cuthbert M. Bede\u2019s The Adventures of Mr. Verdant Green (1857), Thomas Hughes\u2019s Tom Brown at Oxford (1861), and William Makepeace Thackeray\u2019s The History of Pendennis (1850). For everything else, I\u2019ve relied on my memories and my imagination..",
    "For those familiar with Oxford and thus eager to cry, \u2018No, that\u2019s not how things are!\u2019, I\u2019ll now explain some peculiarities. The Oxford Union was not established until 1856, so in this novel it is referred to by the name of its predecessor, the United Debating Society (founded in 1823). My beloved Vaults & Garden caf\u00e9 did not exist until 2003, but I spent so much time there (and ate so many scones there) that I couldn\u2019t deny Robin and company those same pleasures. The Twisted Root as described does not exist, and as far as I\u2019m aware no pub exists in Oxford of that name.",
    "There is also no Taylor\u2019s on Winchester Road though I am pretty fond of the Taylors on High Street. The Oxford Martyrs Monument does exist, but was not completed until 1843, three years after the conclusion of this novel. I\u2019ve moved the date of its construction up just a little bit, all for the sake of a cute reference. The coronation of Queen Victoria happened in June 1838, not 1839.",
    "The Oxford-to-Paddington railway line was not laid until 1844, but here it was constructed several years earlier for two reasons: first, because it makes sense given the altered history; and second, because I needed to get my characters to London a bit faster..",
    "I took a lot of artistic liberties with the commemoration ball, which looks a lot more like a contemporary Oxbridge May/Commemoration Ball than any kind of early-Victorian social event. For instance, I\u2019m aware that oysters were a staple of the early-Victorian poor, but I choose to make them a delicacy because that was my first impression of the 2019 May Ball at Magdalene College, Cambridge \u2013 heaps and heaps of oysters on ice (I hadn\u2019t brought a purse, and was juggling my phone, champagne glass, and oyster in one hand, and spilled champagne all over an old man\u2019s nice dress shoes as a result).",
    "Some may be puzzled by the precise placement of the Royal Institute of Translation, also known as Babel. That is because I\u2019ve warped geography to make space for it. Imagine a green between the Bodleian Libraries, the Sheldonian, and the Radcliffe Camera. Now make it much bigger, and put Babel right in the centre.",
    "The air was rank, the floors slippery. A jug of water sat full, untouched by the bed. At first the boy had been too scared of retching to drink; now he was too weak to lift the jug. He was still conscious, though he\u2019d sunk into a drowsy, half-dreaming haze. Soon, he knew, he\u2019d fall into a deep sleep and fail to wake up. That was what had happened to his grandparents a week ago, then his aunts a day after, and then Miss Betty, the Englishwoman, a day after that.",
    "His mother had perished that morning. He lay beside her body, watching as the blues and purples deepened across her skin. The last thing she\u2019d said to him was his name, two syllables mouthed without breath. Her face had then gone slack and uneven. Her tongue lolled out of her mouth. The boy tried to close her filmy eyes, but her lids kept sliding back open.",
    "No one answered when Professor Lovell knocked. No one exclaimed in surprise when he kicked through the front door \u2013 locked, because plague thieves were stripping the houses in the neighbourhood bare, and though there was little of value in their home, the boy and his mother had wanted a few hours of peace before the sickness took them too. The boy heard all the commotion from upstairs, but he couldn\u2019t bring himself to care.",
    "Professor Lovell made his way up the stairs, crossed the room, and stood over the boy for a long moment. He did not notice, or chose not to notice, the dead woman on the bed. The boy lay still in his shadow, wondering if this tall, pale figure in black had come to reap his soul.",
    "Seconds trickled by. The boy\u2019s breathing steadied. He opened his eyes. He saw Professor Lovell more clearly now, could make out the slate-grey eyes and curved nose \u2013 y\u012bngg\u014dub\u00ed, they called it, a hawk\u2019s-beak nose \u2013 that could only belong on a foreigner\u2019s face.",
    "Professor Lovell bent beneath the bed and pulled out four thick volumes. Books written in English, spines battered from use, some pages worn so thin that the print was barely still legible. The professor flipped through them, smiling despite himself, and placed them in his bag. Then he slid his arms under the boy\u2019s thin frame and lifted him out of the house.",
    "In 1829, the plague that later became known as Asiatic Cholera made its way from Calcutta across the Bay of Bengal to the Far East \u2013 first to Siam, then Manila, then finally the shores of China on merchant ships whose dehydrated, sunken-eyed sailors dumped their waste into the Pearl River, contaminating the waters where thousands drank, laundered, swam, and bathed. It hit Canton like a tidal wave, rapidly working its way from the docks to the inland residential areas. The boy\u2019s neighbourhood had succumbed within weeks, whole families perishing helplessly in their homes.",
    "The boy learned all this when he awoke in a clean, well-lit room in the English Factory, wrapped in blankets softer and whiter than anything he\u2019d ever touched. These only slightly reduced his discomfort. He was terribly hot, and his tongue sat in his mouth like a dense, sandy stone. He felt as though he were floating far above his body. Every time the professor spoke, sharp pangs shot through his temples, accompanied by flashes of red.",
    "The boy stared, fascinated by this foreigner\u2019s long face and pale grey eyes. If he let his gaze drift out of focus, the foreigner morphed into a giant bird. A crow. No, a raptor. Something vicious and strong.",
    "Professor Lovell did not respond. Promptly he stood and brushed at his knees before he left, though the boy could scarcely see how any dust could have accumulated in the few minutes in which he\u2019d been sitting down.",
    "The next morning the boy was able to finish a bowl of broth without retching. The morning after that he managed to stand without much vertigo, though his knees trembled so badly from disuse he had to clutch the bedframe to keep from falling over. His fever receded; his appetite improved. When he woke again that afternoon, he found the bowl replaced with a plate with two thick slices of bread and a hunk of roast beef. He devoured these with his bare hands, famished.",
    "He spent most of the day in dreamless sleep, which was regularly interrupted by the arrival of one Mrs Piper \u2013 a cheery, round woman who plumped his pillows, wiped his forehead with deliciously cool wet cloths, and spoke English with such a peculiar accent that the boy always had to ask her several times to repeat herself.",
    "That evening, Mrs Piper brought him his dinner \u2013 bread and beef again \u2013 along with news that the professor wanted to see him in his office. \u2018It\u2019s just upstairs. The second door to the right. Finish your food first; he\u2019s not going anywhere.\u2019",
    "The boy ate quickly and, with Mrs Piper\u2019s help, got dressed. He didn\u2019t know where the clothes had come from \u2013 they were Western in style, and fitted his short, skinny frame surprisingly well \u2013 but he was too tired then to inquire further.",
    "As he made his way up the stairs he trembled, whether from fatigue or trepidation, he didn\u2019t know. The door to the professor\u2019s study was shut. He paused a moment to catch his breath, and then he knocked.",
    "The door was very heavy. The boy had to lean hard against the wood to budge it open. Inside, he was overwhelmed by the musky, inky scent of books. There were stacks and stacks of them; some were arrayed neatly on shelves, while others were messily piled up in precarious pyramids throughout the room; some were strewn across the floor, while others teetered on the desks that seemed arranged at random within the dimly lit labyrinth.",
    "\u2018Don\u2019t be shy.\u2019 The professor sat behind a grand desk covered with books, loose papers, and envelopes. He gestured for the boy to take a seat across from him. \u2018Did they let you read much here? English wasn\u2019t a problem?\u2019",
    "\u2018I read some.\u2019 The boy sat gingerly, taking care not to tread on the volumes \u2013 Richard Hakluyt\u2019s travel notes, he noticed \u2013 amassed by his feet. \u2018We didn\u2019t have many books. I ended up re-reading what we had.\u2019",
    "For someone who had never left Canton in his life, the boy\u2019s English was remarkably good. He spoke with only a trace of an accent. This was thanks to an Englishwoman \u2013 one Miss Elizabeth Slate, whom the boy had called Miss Betty, and who had lived with his household for as long as he could remember. He never quite understood what she was doing there \u2013 his family was certainly not wealthy enough to employ any servants, especially not a foreigner \u2013 but someone must have been paying her wages because she had never left, not even when the plague hit.",
    "Her Cantonese was passably good, decent enough for her to make her way around town without trouble, but with the boy, she spoke exclusively in English. Her sole duty seemed to be taking care of him, and it was through conversation with her, and later with British sailors at the docks, that the boy had become fluent..",
    "He could read the language better than he spoke it. Ever since the boy turned four, he had received a large parcel twice a year filled entirely with books written in English. The return address was a residence in Hampstead just outside London \u2013 a place Miss Betty seemed unfamiliar with, and which the boy of course knew nothing about. Regardless, he and Miss Betty used to sit together under candlelight, laboriously tracing their fingers over each word as they sounded them out loud. When he grew older, he spent entire afternoons poring over the worn pages on his own.",
    "The boy swallowed, coughed to clear his throat, and began to read. The book was intimidatingly thick, the font very small, and the prose proved considerably more difficult than the breezy adventure novels he\u2019d read with Miss Betty. His tongue tripped over words he didn\u2019t know, words he could only guess at and sound out.",
    "\u2018The par . . . particular ad-advantage which each col-o-colonizing country derives from the col . . . colonies which par . . . particularly belong to it, are of two different kinds; first, those common advantages which every empire de . . . rives?\u2019 He cleared his throat. \u2018Derives . . . from the provinces subject to its dom . . . dom . . .\u2019*",
    "\u2018No, that\u2019s all right,\u2019 said the professor. \u2018I hardly expect you to understand international economics. You did very well.\u2019 He set the book aside, reached into his desk drawer, and pulled out a silver bar. \u2018Remember this?\u2019",
    "He\u2019d seen bars like that before. They were rare in Canton, but everyone knew about them. Y\u00ednf\u00fal\u00f9, silver talismans. He\u2019d seen them embedded in the prows of ships, carved into the sides of palanquins, and installed over the doors of warehouses in the foreign quarter. He\u2019d never figured out precisely what they were, and no one in his household could explain. His grandmother called them rich men\u2019s magic spells, metal amulets carrying blessings from the gods. His mother thought they contained trapped demons who could be summoned to accomplish their masters\u2019 orders.",
    "Even Miss Betty, who made loud her disdain for indigenous Chinese superstition and constantly criticized his mother\u2019s heeding of hungry ghosts, found them unnerving. \u2018They\u2019re witchcraft,\u2019 she\u2019d said when he asked. \u2018They\u2019re devil\u2019s work is what they are.\u2019.",
    "The boy recognized the Chinese characters, though the calligraphy looked a bit strange, as if drawn by someone who had seen them and copied them out radical by radical without knowing what they meant. They read: \u56eb\u5707\u541e\u68d7.",
    "Immediately his tongue swelled up, obstructing his airway. The boy grasped, choking, at his throat. The bar dropped to his lap, where it vibrated wildly, dancing as if possessed. A cloyingly sweet taste filled his mouth. Like dates, the boy thought faintly, black pushing in at the edges of his vision. Strong, jammy dates, so ripe they were sickening. He was drowning in them. His throat was wholly blocked, he couldn\u2019t breathe\u2014",
    "The boy wiped tears from his eyes, sniffling. Professor Lovell sat back, waiting for the boy to recover somewhat before he continued. \u2018In two days, Mrs Piper and I will depart this country for a city called London in a country called England. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard of both.\u2019",
    "\u2018I propose to bring you with us. You will live at my estate, and I will provide you with room and board until you\u2019ve grown old enough to make your own living. In return, you will take courses in a curriculum of my design. It will be language work \u2013 Latin, Greek, and of course, Mandarin. You will enjoy an easy, comfortable life, and the best education that one can afford. All I expect in return is that you apply yourself diligently to your studies.\u2019",
    "Professor Lovell clasped his hands together as if in prayer. The boy found his tone confusing. It was utterly flat and dispassionate. He could not tell if Professor Lovell wanted him in London or not; indeed, this seemed less like an adoption and more like a business proposal.",
    "\u2018I urge you to strongly consider it,\u2019 Professor Lovell continued. \u2018Your mother and grandparents are dead, your father unknown, and you have no extended family. Stay here, and you won\u2019t have a penny to your name. All you will ever know is poverty, disease, and starvation. You\u2019ll find work on the docks if you\u2019re lucky, but you\u2019re still small yet, so you\u2019ll spend a few years begging or stealing. Assuming you reach adulthood, the best you can hope for is backbreaking labour on the ships.\u2019",
    "The boy found himself staring, fascinated, at Professor Lovell\u2019s face as he spoke. It was not as though he had never encountered an Englishman before. He had met plenty of sailors at the docks, had seen the entire range of white men\u2019s faces, from the broad and ruddy to the diseased and liver-spotted to the long, pale, and severe. But the professor\u2019s face presented an entirely different puzzle. His had all the components of a standard human face \u2013 eyes, lips, nose, teeth, all healthy and normal. His voice was a low, somewhat flat, but nevertheless human voice.",
    "But when he spoke, his tone and expression were entirely devoid of emotion. He was a blank slate. The boy could not guess his feelings at all. As the professor described the boy\u2019s early, inevitable death, he could have been reciting ingredients for a stew..",
    "\u2018These are the terms of my guardianship.\u2019 Professor Lovell slid a two-page document across the desk. The boy glanced down, then gave up trying to skim it; the tight, looping penmanship looked nigh illegible. \u2018They\u2019re quite simple, but take care to read the entire thing before you sign it. Will you do this tonight before you go to bed?\u2019",
    "She had, in fact. When the boy turned four, she had insisted he adopt a name by which Englishmen could take him seriously, though she\u2019d never elaborated which Englishmen those might be. They\u2019d chosen something at random from a children\u2019s rhyming book, and the boy liked how firm and round the syllables felt on his tongue, so he harboured no complaint. But no one else in the household had ever used it, and soon Miss Betty had dropped it as well. The boy had to think hard for a moment before he remembered.",
    "\u2018The English reinvent their names all the time,\u2019 said Professor Lovell. \u2018The only families who keep theirs do it because they have titles to hold on to, and you certainly haven\u2019t got any. You only need a handle to introduce yourself by. Any name will do.\u2019",
    "\u2018Oh \u2013 of course.\u2019 The boy\u2019s eyes cast desperately around the room, searching for some word or sound to latch on to. They landed on a familiar volume on the shelf above Professor Lovell\u2019s head \u2013 Gulliver\u2019s Travels. A stranger in a strange land, who had to learn the local languages if he wished not to die. He thought he understood now how Gulliver felt.",
    "To his surprise, Professor Lovell laughed. Laughter was strange coming out of that severe mouth; it sounded too abrupt, almost cruel, and the boy couldn\u2019t help but flinch. \u2018Very good. Robin Swift you\u2019ll be. Mr Swift, good to meet you.\u2019",
    "He rose and extended his hand across the desk. The boy had seen foreign sailors greeting each other at the docks, so he knew what to do. He met that large, dry, uncomfortably cool hand with his own. They shook.",
    "Two days later, Professor Lovell, Mrs Piper, and the newly christened Robin Swift set sail for London. By then, thanks to many hours of bed rest and a steady diet of hot milk and Mrs Piper\u2019s abundant cooking, Robin was well enough to walk on his own. He lugged a trunk heavy with books up the gangplank, struggling to keep pace with the professor.",
    "Canton\u2019s harbour, the mouth from which China encountered the world, was a universe of languages. Loud and rapid Portuguese, French, Dutch, Swedish, Danish, English, and Chinese floated through the salty air, intermingling in an implausibly mutually intelligible pidgin which almost everyone understood, but which only a few could speak with ease. Robin knew it well. He\u2019d gained his first instruction in foreign languages running about the quays; he\u2019d often translated for sailors in exchange for a tossed penny and a smile.",
    "They walked down the waterfront to join the boarding line for the Countess of Harcourt, one of the East India Company ships that took on a small number of commercial passengers on each voyage. The sea was loud and choppy that day. Robin shivered as frigid seaside gusts cut viciously through his coat. He badly wanted to be on the ship, inside a cabin or anywhere with walls, but something held up the boarding line. Professor Lovell stepped to the side to have a look. Robin followed him.",
    "Robin stumbled forward into the fray. Both the crewman and the labourer turned to look at him. The crewman merely looked annoyed, but the labourer seemed relieved \u2013 he seemed to recognize immediately in Robin\u2019s face an ally, the only other Chinese person in sight.",
    "Robin opened it. The paper was written in English, and it did indeed look like a lascar contract \u2013 a certificate of pay to last for the length of one voyage from Canton to London, to be specific. Robin had seen such contracts before; they had grown increasingly common over the past several years as the demand for indentured Chinese servants grew concurrently with overseas difficulties with the slave trade. This was not the first contract he\u2019d translated; he\u2019d seen work orders for Chinese labourers to board for destinations as far away as Portugal, India, and the West Indies.",
    "\u2018What\u2019s he telling you?\u2019 asked the crewman. \u2018Tell him that contract\u2019s no good. I can\u2019t have Chinamen on this ship. Last ship I sailed that carried a Chinaman got filthy with lice. I\u2019m not taking risks on people who can\u2019t wash. Couldn\u2019t even understand the word bath if I yelled it at him, this one. Hello? Boy? Do you understand what I\u2019m saying?\u2019",
    "The labourer, uncomprehending, cast Robin an imploring look. His face was creased and sun-browned, leathered in a way that made him look sixty, though he was likely only in his thirties. All lascars aged quickly; the work wrecked their bodies. Robin had seen that face a thousand times before at the docks. Some tossed him sweets; some knew him well enough to greet him by name. He associated that face with his own kind. But he\u2019d never seen one of his elders turn to him with such total helplessness.",
    "But what could he possibly say? He saw the crewman\u2019s blistering irritation. He saw the rustling impatience of the other passengers in the queue. They were tired, they were cold, they couldn\u2019t understand why they hadn\u2019t boarded yet. He felt Professor Lovell\u2019s thumb digging a groove into his collarbone, and a thought struck him \u2013 a thought so frightening that it made his knees tremble \u2013 which was that should he pose too much of a problem, should he stir up trouble, then the Countess of Harcourt might simply leave him behind onshore as well.",
    "The labourer gaped at him. A thousand emotions worked through that weathered face \u2013 indignation, frustration, and finally, resignation. Robin had been afraid the labourer might argue, might fight, but quickly it became clear that for this man, such treatment was nothing new. This had happened before. The labourer turned and made his way down the gangplank, shoving passengers aside as he did. In a few moments he was gone from sight.",
    "\u2018Oh, you\u2019re shaking, poor thing.\u2019 She was immediately on him like a mother hen, enveloping him within her shawl. She spoke a sharp word to Professor Lovell. He sighed, nodded; then they bustled through to the front of the line, from which they were whisked straight to their cabins while a porter collected their luggage and carried it behind them.",
    "Robin was settled on his bunk with a thick blanket wrapped around his shoulders, and he would have happily stayed there all day, but Mrs Piper urged him back above deck to watch the receding shoreline. He felt a sharp ache in his chest as Canton disappeared over the horizon, and then a raw emptiness, as if a grappling hook had yanked his heart out of his body. It had not registered until now that he would not step foot on his native shore again for many years, if ever. He wasn\u2019t sure what to make of this fact. The word loss was inadequate.",
    "He spent the first few days of the voyage sleeping. He was still recuperating; Mrs Piper insisted he take daily walks above deck for his health, but initially he could manage only a few minutes at a time before he had to lie down. He was fortunate to be spared the nausea of seasickness; a childhood along docks and rivers had habituated his senses to the roiling instability. When he felt strong enough to spend whole afternoons above deck, he loved sitting by the railings, watching the ceaseless waves changing colour with the sky, feeling the ocean spray on his face.",
    "Occasionally Professor Lovell would chat with him as they paced the deck together. Robin learned quickly that the professor was a precise and reticent man. He offered up information when he thought Robin needed it, but otherwise, he was happy to let questions lie.",
    "He told Robin they would reside in his estate in Hampstead when they reached England. He did not say whether he had family at that estate. He confirmed that he had paid Miss Betty all those years, but did not explain why. He intimated that he\u2019d known Robin\u2019s mother, which was how he\u2019d known Robin\u2019s address, but he did not elaborate on the nature of their relationship or how they\u2019d met. The only time he acknowledged their prior acquaintance was when he asked Robin how his family came to live in that riverside shack.",
    "Months ago Robin would have spat at anyone for speaking so cruelly about his family. But here, alone in the middle of the ocean with no relatives and nothing to his name, he could not summon the ire. He had no fire left in him. He was only scared, and so very tired.",
    "In any case, all this accorded with what Robin had been told of his family\u2019s previous wealth, which had been squandered completely in the years after his birth. His mother had complained about it bitterly and often. Robin was fuzzy on the details, but the story involved what so many tales of decline in Qing dynasty China did: an aging patriarch, a profligate son, malicious and manipulative friends, and a helpless daughter whom, for some mysterious reason, no one would marry. Once, he\u2019d been told, he\u2019d slept in a lacquered crib.",
    "Once, they\u2019d enjoyed a dozen servants and a chef who cooked rare delicacies imported from northern markets. Once, they\u2019d lived in an estate that could have housed five families, with peacocks roaming about the yard. But all Robin had ever known was the little house on the river..",
    "\u2018My mother said that my uncle lost all their money at the opium houses,\u2019 Robin told him. \u2018Debtors seized their estate, and we had to move. Then my uncle went missing when I was three, and it was just us and my aunts and grandparents. And Miss Betty.\u2019",
    "Apart from these talks, the professor spent most of the day holed up in his cabin. They saw him only semi-regularly in the mess for dinners; more often Mrs Piper had to fill a plate with hardtack and dried pork and take it to his room.",
    "\u2018He\u2019s working on his translations,\u2019 Mrs Piper told Robin. \u2018He\u2019s always picking up scrolls and old books on these trips, you see, and he likes to get a head start on rendering them into English before he gets back to London. They keep him so busy there \u2013 he\u2019s a very important man, a fellow of the Royal Asiatic Society, you know \u2013 and he says sea voyages are the only time he gets any peace and quiet. Isn\u2019t that funny. He bought some nice rhyming dictionaries in Macau \u2013 lovely things, though he won\u2019t let me touch them, the pages are so fragile.\u2019",
    "Robin was startled to hear that they\u2019d been to Macau. He had not been aware of any Macau trip; naively, he\u2019d imagined he was the only reason why Professor Lovell had come to China at all. \u2018How long were you there? In Macau, I mean.\u2019",
    "\u2018Oh, two weeks and some change. It would have been just two, but we were held up at customs. They don\u2019t like letting foreign women onto the mainland \u2013 I had to dress up and pretend to be the professor\u2019s uncle, can you imagine!\u2019",
    "He had no right to be resentful. Professor Lovell had promised him everything, and owed him nothing. Robin did not yet fully understand the rules of this world he was about to enter, but he understood the necessity of gratitude. Of deference. One did not spite one\u2019s saviours.",
    "Time blurred. The sun rose and set, but without the regularity of routine \u2013 he had no chores, no water to fetch or errands to run \u2013 the days all seemed the same no matter the hour. Robin slept, reread his old books, and paced the decks. Occasionally he struck up a conversation with the other passengers, who always seemed delighted to hear a near pitch-perfect Londoner\u2019s accent out of the mouth of this little Oriental boy. Recalling Professor Lovell\u2019s words, he tried very hard to live exclusively in English. When thoughts popped up in Chinese, he quashed them.",
    "He quashed his memories too. His life in Canton \u2013 his mother, his grandparents, a decade of running about the docks \u2013 it all proved surprisingly easy to shed, perhaps because this passage was so jarring, the break so complete. He\u2019d left behind everything he\u2019d known. There was nothing to cling to, nothing to escape back to. His world now was Professor Lovell, Mrs Piper, and the promise of a country on the other side of the ocean. He buried his past life, not because it was so terrible but because abandoning it was the only way to survive.",
    "He pulled on his English accent like a new coat, adjusted everything he could about himself to make it fit, and, within weeks, wore it with comfort. In weeks, no one was asking him to speak a few words in Chinese for their entertainment. In weeks, no one seemed to remember he was Chinese at all..",
    "One morning, Mrs Piper woke him very early. He made some noises of protest, but she insisted. \u2018Come, dear, you won\u2019t want to miss this.\u2019 Yawning, he pulled on a jacket. He was still rubbing his eyes when they emerged above deck into a cold morning shrouded in mist so thick Robin could hardly see the prow of the ship. But then the fog cleared, and a grey-black silhouette emerged over the horizon, and that was the first glimpse Robin ever had of London: the Silver City, the heart of the British Empire, and in that era, the largest and richest city in the world.",
    "London was drab and grey; was exploding in colour; was a raucous din, bursting with life; was eerily quiet, haunted by ghosts and graveyards. As the Countess of Harcourt sailed inland down the River Thames into the dockyards at the beating heart of the capital, Robin saw immediately that London was, like Canton, a city of contradictions and multitudes, as was any city that acted as a mouth to the world.",
    "But unlike Canton, London had a mechanical heartbeat. Silver hummed through the city. It glimmered from the wheels of cabs and carriages and from horses\u2019 hooves; shone from buildings under windows and over doorways; lay buried under the streets and up in the ticking arms of clock towers; was displayed in shopfronts whose signs proudly boasted the magical amplifications of their breads, boots, and baubles. The lifeblood of London carried a sharp, tinny timbre wholly unlike the rickety, clacking bamboo that underwrote Canton.",
    "It was artificial, metallic \u2013 the sound of a knife screeching across a sharpening steel; it was the monstrous industrial labyrinth of William Blake\u2019s \u2018cruel Works / Of many Wheels I view, wheel without wheel, with cogs tyrannic, moving by compulsion each other\u2019.*.",
    "London had accumulated the lion\u2019s share of both the world\u2019s silver ore and the world\u2019s languages, and the result was a city that was bigger, heavier, faster, and brighter than nature allowed. London was voracious, was growing fat on its spoils and still, somehow, starved. London was both unimaginably rich and wretchedly poor.",
    "London \u2013 lovely, ugly, sprawling, cramped, belching, sniffing, virtuous, hypocritical, silver-gilded London \u2013 was near to a reckoning, for the day would come when it either devoured itself from inside or cast outwards for new delicacies, labour, capital, and culture on which to feed..",
    "But the scales had not yet tipped, and the revels, for now, could be sustained. When Robin, Professor Lovell, and Mrs Piper stepped ashore at the Port of London, the docks were a flurry of the colonial trade at its apex. Ships heavy with chests of tea, cotton, and tobacco, their masts and crossbeams studded with silver that made them sail more quickly and safely, sat waiting to be emptied in preparation for the next voyage to India, to the West Indies, to Africa, to the Far East. They sent British wares across the world. They brought back chests of silver.",
    "Silver bars had been used in London \u2013 and indeed, throughout the world \u2013 for a millennium, but not since the height of the Spanish Empire had any place in the world been so rich in or so reliant on silver\u2019s power. Silver lining the canals made the water fresher and cleaner than any river like the Thames had a right to be. Silver in the gutters disguised the stink of rain, sludge, and sewage with the scent of invisible roses.",
    "Silver in the clock towers made the bells chime for miles and miles further than they should have, until the notes clashed discordantly against each other throughout the city and over the countryside..",
    "Silver was in the seats of the two-wheeled Hansom cabs Professor Lovell hailed when they had cleared customs \u2013 one for the three of them, and a second for their trunks. As they settled in, tightly nestled against each other in the tiny carriage, Professor Lovell reached over his knees and pointed out a silver bar embedded in the floor of the carriage.",
    "\u2018Sp\u0113s,\u2019 said Professor Lovell. \u2018It\u2019s Latin. It\u2019s the root word of the English speed, and it means a nexus of things involving hope, fortune, success, and reaching one\u2019s goal. Makes the carriages run a bit more safely and quickly.\u2019",
    "\u2018In time.\u2019 Professor Lovell patted him on the shoulder. \u2018But yes, Robin Swift. You\u2019ll be one of the few scholars in the world that knows the secrets of silver-working. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve brought you here to do.\u2019",
    "Two hours in the cab brought them to a village called Hampstead several miles north of London proper, where Professor Lovell owned a four-storey house made of pale red brick and white stucco, surrounded by a generous swath of neat green shrubbery.",
    "The house was very dark and chilly inside. Mrs Piper went about pulling open the curtains, while Robin dragged his trunk up the spiralling staircase and down the hall as instructed. His room consisted of only a little furniture \u2013 a writing desk, a bed, and a sitting chair \u2013 and was bare of any decorations or possessions except for the corner bookshelf, which was packed with so many titles that his treasured collection felt paltry in comparison.",
    "Curious, Robin approached. Had those books been prepared especially for him? That felt unlikely, though many of the titles looked like things he would enjoy \u2013 the top shelf alone had a number of Swifts and Defoes, novels by his favourite authors he hadn\u2019t known existed. Ah, there was Gulliver\u2019s Travels. He pulled the book off the shelf. It seemed well-worn, some pages creased and dog-eared and others stained by tea or coffee.",
    "He replaced the book, confused. Someone else must have lived in this room before him. Some other boy, perhaps \u2013 someone his age, who loved Jonathan Swift just as much, who had read this copy of Gulliver\u2019s Travels so many times that the ink at the top right where one\u2019s finger turned the page was starting to fade.",
    "He meant this literally. For the rest of the afternoon, Professor Lovell took Robin on a series of errands in the service of assimilating him into British civil society. They saw a physician who weighed him, examined him, and reluctantly declared him fit for life on the island: \u2018No tropical diseases nor fleas, thank heavens. He\u2019s a bit small for his age, but raise him on mutton and mash and he\u2019ll be fine. Now let\u2019s have a smallpox jab \u2013 roll that sleeve up, please, thank you. It won\u2019t hurt.",
    "Count to three.\u2019 They saw a barber, who clipped Robin\u2019s unruly, chin-length curls into a short, neat crop above his ears. They saw a hatter, a bootmaker, and finally a tailor, who measured every inch of Robin\u2019s body and showed him several bolts of cloth among which Robin, overwhelmed, chose at random..",
    "As the afternoon wound down, they went to the courthouse for an appointment with a solicitor who drafted a set of papers which, Robin was told, would make him a legal citizen of the United Kingdom and a ward under the guardianship of Professor Richard Linton Lovell.",
    "Why?, he almost asked. Something important hinged on that question, though he was still too young to know what precisely it was. A moment stretched between them, pregnant with possibility. The solicitor scratched his nose. Professor Lovell cleared his throat. But the moment passed without comment. Professor Lovell was not forthcoming, and Robin already knew better than to press. He signed.",
    "Mrs Piper and her kitchen had enjoyed a glorious reunion. The dining room table, which seemed ridiculously large for just the two of them, was piled with pitchers of milk, white rolls of bread, roast carrots and potatoes, gravy, something still simmering in a silver-gilded tureen, and what looked like an entire glazed chicken. Robin hadn\u2019t eaten since that morning; he should have been famished, but he was so exhausted that the sight of all that food made his stomach twist.",
    "Instead, he turned his eyes to a painting that hung behind the table. It was impossible to ignore; it dominated the entire room. It depicted a beautiful city at dusk, but it was not London, he didn\u2019t think. It seemed more dignified. More ancient.",
    "He pointed to a grand domed building in the middle of the painting. \u2018This is the Radcliffe Library. And this,\u2019 he gestured to a tower beside it, the tallest building in the landscape, \u2018is the Royal Institute of Translation. This is where I teach, and where I spend the majority of the year when I\u2019m not in London.\u2019",
    "He spread his hands through the air, as if envisioning Oxford before him. \u2018Imagine a town of scholars, all researching the most marvellous, fascinating things. Science. Mathematics. Languages. Literature. Imagine building after building filled with more books than you\u2019ve seen in your entire life. Imagine quiet, solitude, and a serene place to think.\u2019 He sighed. \u2018London is a blathering mess. It\u2019s impossible to get anything done here; the city\u2019s too loud, and it demands too much of you.",
    "You can escape out to places like Hampstead, but the screaming core draws you back in whether you like it or not. But Oxford gives you all the tools you need for your work \u2013 food, clothes, books, tea \u2013 and then it leaves you alone. It is the centre of all knowledge and innovation in the civilized world. And, should you progress sufficiently well in your studies here, you might one day be lucky enough to call it home.\u2019.",
    "The only appropriate response here seemed to be an awed silence. Professor Lovell gazed wistfully at the painting. Robin tried to match his enthusiasm, but could not help glancing sideways at the professor. The softness in his eyes, the longing, startled him. In the little time he\u2019d known him, Robin had never seen Professor Lovell express such fondness for anything.",
    "As soon as breakfast concluded, Professor Lovell instructed Robin to wash and return to the drawing room in ten minutes. There waited a portly, smiling gentleman named Mr Felton \u2013 a first class at Oxford, an Oriel man, mind you \u2013 and yes, he\u2019d make sure Robin was up to Oxford\u2019s Latinate speed. The boy was starting a bit late compared to his peers, but if he studied hard, that could be easily remedied.",
    "Thus began a morning of memorizing basic vocabulary \u2013 agricola, terra, aqua \u2013 which was daunting, but then seemed easy compared to the head-spinning explanations of declensions and conjugations which followed. Robin had never been taught the fundamentals of grammar \u2013 he knew what worked in English because it sounded right \u2013 and so in learning Latin, he learned the basic parts of language itself. Noun, verb, subject, predicate, copula; then the nominative, genitive, accusative cases . . .",
    "He absorbed a bewildering amount of material over the next three hours, and had forgotten half of it by the time the lesson ended, but he came away with a deep appreciation of language and all the words for what you could do with it..",
    "\u2018That\u2019s all right, lad.\u2019 Mr Felton, thankfully, was a patient fellow, and seemed sympathetic to the mental brutalization he\u2019d subjected Robin to. \u2018You\u2019ll have much more fun after we\u2019ve finished laying the groundwork. Just wait until we get to Cicero.\u2019 He peered down at Robin\u2019s notes. \u2018But you\u2019ve got to be more careful with your spelling.\u2019",
    "Mr Felton rapped the table with his knuckles. \u2018Even the length of a single vowel matters, Robin Swift. Consider the Bible. The original Hebrew text never specifies what sort of forbidden fruit the serpent persuades Eve to eat. But in Latin, malum means \u201cbad\u201d and m\u0101lum,\u2019 he wrote the words out for Robin, emphasizing the macron with force, \u2018means \u201capple\u201d. It was a short leap from there to blaming the apple for the original sin. But for all we know, the real culprit could be a persimmon.\u2019",
    "Mr Felton departed at lunchtime, after assigning a list of nearly a hundred vocabulary words to memorize before the following morning. Robin ate alone in the drawing room, mechanically shoving ham and potatoes into his mouth as he blinked uncomprehendingly at his grammar.",
    "But there was no reprieve. At two on the dot, a thin, grey-whiskered gentleman who introduced himself as Mr Chester arrived at the house, and for the next three hours, they commenced Robin\u2019s education in Ancient Greek.",
    "Greek was an exercise in making the familiar strange. Its alphabet mapped onto the Roman alphabet, but only partly so, and often letters did not sound how they looked \u2013 a rho (P) was not a P, and an eta (H) was not an H. Like Latin, it made use of conjugations and declensions, but there were a good deal more moods, tenses, and voices to keep track of. Its inventory of sounds seemed further from English than Latin\u2019s did, and Robin kept struggling not to make Greek tones sound like Chinese tones.",
    "Mr Chester was harsher than Mr Felton, and became snippy and irritable when Robin kept flubbing his verb endings. By the end of the afternoon, Robin felt so lost that it was all he could do to simply repeat the sounds Mr Chester spat at him..",
    "\u2018But I don\u2019t see why they have to be quite so complicated,\u2019 Robin said with sudden vehemence. He couldn\u2019t help it; his frustration had been mounting since noon. \u2018I mean, why so many rules? Why so many endings? Chinese doesn\u2019t have any of those; we haven\u2019t got tenses or declensions or conjugations. Chinese is much simpler\u2014\u2019",
    "\u2018You\u2019re wrong there,\u2019 said Professor Lovell. \u2018Every language is complex in its own way. Latin just happens to work its complexity into the shape of the word. Its morphological richness is an asset, not an obstacle. Consider the sentence He will learn. T\u0101 hu\u00ec xu\u00e9. Three words in both English and Chinese. In Latin, it takes only one. Disce. Much more elegant, you see?\u2019",
    "This routine \u2013 Latin in the morning, Greek in the afternoon \u2013 became Robin\u2019s life for the foreseeable future. He was grateful for this, despite the toil. At last, he had some structure to his days. He felt less unrooted and bewildered now \u2013 he had a purpose, he had a place, and even though he still couldn\u2019t quite fathom why this life had fallen to him, of all the dock boys in Canton, he took to his duties with determined, uncomplaining diligence.",
    "Twice a week he had conversational practice with Professor Lovell in Mandarin.* At first, he could not understand the point. These dialogues felt artificial, stilted, and most of all, unnecessary. He was fluent already; he didn\u2019t stumble over vocabulary recall or pronunciations the way he did when he and Mr Felton conversed in Latin. Why should he answer such basic questions as how he found his dinner, or what he thought about the weather?",
    "\u2018You\u2019ve grown up with solid foundations in Mandarin, Cantonese, and English. That\u2019s very fortunate \u2013 there are adults who spend their lifetimes trying to achieve what you have. And even if they do, they achieve only a passable fluency \u2013 enough to get by, if they think hard and recall vocabulary before speaking \u2013 but nothing close to a native fluency where words come unbidden, without lag or labour.",
    "You, on the other hand, have already mastered the hardest parts of two language systems \u2013 the accents and rhythm, those unconscious quirks that adults take forever to learn, and even then, not quite. But you must maintain them. You can\u2019t squander your natural gifts.\u2019.",
    "\u2018Not as well as you think you do. Plenty of people speak it, but few of them really know it, its roots and skeletons. But you need to know the history, shape, and depths of a language, particularly if you plan to manipulate it as you will one day learn to do. And you\u2019ll need to attain that mastery of Chinese as well. That begins with practising what you have.\u2019",
    "Professor Lovell was right. It was, Robin discovered, startlingly easy to lose a language that had once felt as familiar as his own skin. In London, without another Chinese person in sight, at least not in the circles of London where he lived, his mother tongue sounded like babble. Uttered in that drawing room, the most quintessentially English of spaces, it didn\u2019t feel like it belonged. It felt made-up. And it scared him, sometimes, how often his memory would lapse, how the syllables he\u2019d grown up around could suddenly sound so unfamiliar.",
    "He put twice the effort into Chinese that he did into Greek and Latin. For hours a day he practised writing out his characters, labouring over every stroke until he achieved a perfect replica of the characters in print. He reached into his memory to recall how Chinese conversations felt, how Mandarin sounded when it rolled naturally off his tongue, when he didn\u2019t have to pause to remember the tones of the next word he uttered.",
    "But he was forgetting. That terrified him. Sometimes, during practice conversations, he found himself blanking on a word he used to toss around constantly. And sometimes he sounded, to his own ears, like a European sailor imitating Chinese without knowing what he said.",
    "He could fix it, though. He would. Through practice, through memorization, through daily compositions \u2013 it wasn\u2019t the same as living and breathing Mandarin, but it was close enough. He was of an age when the language had made a permanent impression on his mind. But he had to try, really try, to make sure that he did not stop dreaming in his native tongue.",
    "At least thrice a week Professor Lovell received a variety of guests in his sitting room. Robin supposed they must have also been scholars, for often they came bearing stacks of books or bound manuscripts, which they would pore over and debate about until the late hours of the night. Several of these men, it turned out, could speak Chinese, and Robin sometimes hid out over the banister, eavesdropping on the very strange sound of Englishmen discussing the finer points of Classical Chinese grammar over afternoon tea.",
    "Professor Lovell seemed to prefer that Robin keep out of sight when company came. He never explicitly forbade Robin\u2019s presence, but he would make a note to say that Mr Woodbridge and Mr Ratcliffe were visiting at eight, which Robin interpreted to mean that he ought to make himself scarce.",
    "Robin had no issue with this arrangement. Admittedly, he found their conversations fascinating \u2013 they spoke often of far-flung things like expeditions to the West Indies, negotiations over cotton prints in India, and violent unrest throughout the Near East. But as a group, they were frightening; a procession of solemn, erudite men, all dressed in black like a murder of crows, each more intimidating than the last.",
    "The only time he barged in on one of these gatherings was by accident. He\u2019d been out in the garden, taking his daily physician-recommended turn, when he overheard the professor and his guests loudly discussing Canton.",
    "\u2018My goodness.\u2019 The fourth man, whose pale blue eyes Robin found unnerving, bent down to inspect him, as if through a massive, invisible magnifying glass. \u2018Is this the new one? He\u2019s even more of your spitting image than the last\u2014\u2019",
    "Robin muttered an apology and hurried up the stairs, muddy boots forgotten. Over his shoulder, he heard fragments of Professor Lovell\u2019s response: \u2018He doesn\u2019t know, I don\u2019t like giving him ideas . . . No, Hayward, I won\u2019t\u2014\u2019 But by the time he reached the safety of the landing, where he could lean over the banister and listen in without being caught, they had already changed the topic to Afghanistan.",
    "His aunts liked to say he had the kind of face that could blend in anywhere \u2013 his hair and eyes, both a softer shade of brown than the indigo-black that coloured the rest of his family, could have plausibly marked him as either the son of a Portuguese sailor or the heir to the Qing Emperor. But Robin had always attributed this to some accidental arrangement of nature that ascribed him features that could have belonged anywhere on the spectrum of either race, white or yellow.",
    "But even then, Robin was not too young to understand there were some truths that could not be uttered, that life as normal was only possible if they were never acknowledged. He had a roof over his head, three guaranteed meals a day, and access to more books than he could read in a lifetime. He did not, he knew, have the right to demand anything more.",
    "He made a decision then. He would never question Professor Lovell, never probe at the empty space where the truth belonged. As long as Professor Lovell did not accept him as a son, Robin would not attempt to claim him as a father. A lie was not a lie if it was never uttered; questions that were never asked did not need answers. They would both remain perfectly content to linger in the liminal, endless space between truth and denial.",
    "When Michaelmas term began in early October, Professor Lovell departed for Oxford, where he would stay for the next eight weeks. He would do this for each of Oxford\u2019s three academic terms, returning only during the breaks. Robin relished these periods; even though his classes did not pause, it felt possible to breathe and relax then without risk of disappointing his guardian at every turn.",
    "Professor Lovell gave him no allowance, but Mrs Piper occasionally let him have some small change for fares, which he saved up until he could get to Covent Garden by carriage. When he learned from a paperboy about the horse-drawn omnibus service, he rode it almost every weekend, crisscrossing the heart of London from Paddington Green to the Bank. His first few trips alone terrified him; several times he grew convinced he would never find his way back to Hampstead again and would be doomed to live out his life as a waif on the streets. But he persisted.",
    "He refused to be cowed by London\u2019s complexity, for wasn\u2019t Canton, too, a labyrinth? He determined to make the place home by walking every inch of it. Bit by bit London grew to feel less overwhelming, less like a belching, contorted pit of monsters that might swallow him up at any corner and more like a navigable maze whose tricks and turns he could anticipate..",
    "He read the city. London in the 1830s was exploding with print. Newspapers, magazines, journals, quarterlies, weeklies, monthlies, and books of every genre were flying off the shelves, tossed on doorsteps, and hawked from the corners of nearly every street.",
    "He pored over newsstand copies of The Times, the Standard, and the Morning Post; he read, though did not fully comprehend, articles in academic journals like Edinburgh Review and Quarterly Review; he read penny satirical papers like Figaro in London, melodramatic pseudo-news like colourful crime reports and a series on the dying confessions of condemned prisoners. For cheaper stuff, he entertained himself with the Bawbee Bagpipe. He stumbled on a series called The Pickwick Papers by someone named Charles Dickens, who was very funny but seemed to hate very much anyone who was not white.",
    "He discovered Fleet Street, the heart of London publishing, where newspapers came off the printing presses still hot. He went back there time and time again, bringing home stacks of yesterday\u2019s papers for free from piles that were dumped on the corner..",
    "He didn\u2019t understand half of what he read, even if he could decipher all the individual words. The texts were packed with political allusions, inside jokes, slang, and conventions that he\u2019d never learned. In lieu of a childhood spent absorbing it all in London, he tried devouring the corpus instead, tried to plough through references to things like Tories, Whigs, Chartists, and Reformers and memorize what they were. He learned what the Corn Laws were and what they had to do with a Frenchman named Napoleon.",
    "He learned who the Catholics and Protestants were, and how the (he thought, at least) small doctrinal differences between the two were apparently a matter of great and bloody importance. He learned that being English was not the same as being British, though he was still hard-pressed to articulate the difference between the two..",
    "He read the city, and he learned its language. New words in English were a game to him, for in understanding the word he always came to understand something about English history or culture itself. He delighted when common words were, unexpectedly, formed from other words he knew. Hussy was a compound of house and wife. Holiday was a compound of holy and day. Bedlam came, implausibly, from Bethlehem. Goodbye was, incredibly, a shortened version of God be with you.",
    "In London\u2019s East End he encountered Cockney rhyming slang, which initially presented a great mystery, for he had no clue how Hampstead could come to mean \u2018teeth.\u2019* But once he learned about the omitted rhyming component, he had great fun coming up with his own. (Mrs Piper was not very amused when he began referring to dinner as the \u2018meal of saints\u2019.)*.",
    "Long after he learned the proper meanings of words and phrases that had once confused him, his mind still formed funny associations around them. He imagined the Cabinet as a series of massive shelves where men in fancy dress were arranged like dolls. He thought the Whigs were named for their wigs, and the Tories for the young Princess Victoria. He imagined Marylebone was composed of marble and bone, that Belgravia was a land of bells and graves, and that Chelsea was named for shells and the sea.",
    "He learned that a pound was worth twenty shillings, and a shilling was worth twelve pence \u2013 clarity on florins, groats, and farthings would have to come in time. He learned there were many types of British people, just as there were many types of Chinese people, and that being Irish or Welsh was distinct in important ways from being English. He learned Mrs Piper was from a place called Scotland, which made her a Scot, and also explained why her accent, lilting and rhotic, sounded so different from Professor Lovell\u2019s crisp, straight intonations.",
    "He learned that London in 1830 was a city that could not decide what it wanted to be. The Silver City was the largest financial centre of the world, the leading edge of industry and technology. But its profits were not shared equally. London was as much a city of plays at Covent Garden and balls in Mayfair as it was a city of teeming slums around St Giles.",
    "London was a city of reformers, a place where the likes of William Wilberforce and Robert Wedderburn had urged the abolition of slavery; where the Spa Fields riots had ended with the leaders charged for high treason; where Owenites had tried to get everyone to join their utopian socialist communities (he was still not sure what socialism was yet); and where Mary Wollstonecraft\u2019s Vindication of the Rights of Woman, published only forty years ago, had inspired waves of loud, proud feminists and suffragists in its wake.",
    "He discovered that in Parliament, in town halls, and on the streets, reformers of every stripe were fighting for the soul of London, while a conservative, landed ruling class fought back against attempts at change at every turn..",
    "He did not understand these political struggles, not then. He only sensed that London, and England at large, was very divided about what it was and what it wanted to be. And he understood that silver lay behind it all.",
    "For when the Radicals wrote about the perils of industrialization, and when the Conservatives refuted this with proof of the booming economy; when any of the political parties spoke about slums, housing, roads, transportation, agriculture, and manufacturing; when anyone spoke about Britain and the Empire\u2019s future at all, the word was always there in papers, pamphlets, magazines, and even prayer books: silver, silver, silver..",
    "From Mrs Piper, he learned more than he\u2019d imagined possible about English food and England. Adjusting to this new palate took some time. He had never thought much about food when he lived in Canton \u2013 the porridge, steamed buns, dumplings, and vegetable dishes that comprised his daily meals had seemed unremarkable to him. They were the staples of a poor family\u2019s diet, a far cry from high Chinese cuisine. Now he was astonished by how much he missed them. The English made regular use of only two flavours \u2013 salty and not salty \u2013 and did not seem to recognize any of the others.",
    "For a country that profited so well from trading in spices, its citizens were violently averse to actually using them; in all his time in Hampstead, he never tasted a dish that could be properly described as \u2018seasoned\u2019, let alone \u2018spicy\u2019..",
    "He took more pleasure in learning about the food than in eating it. This education came unprompted \u2013 dear Mrs Piper was the chatty sort, and would happily lecture as she served up lunch if Robin displayed even the slightest interest in what was on his plate. He was told that potatoes, which he found quite tasty in any form, were not to be served around important company, for they were considered lower-class.",
    "He found that newly invented silver-gilded dishes were used to keep food warm throughout a meal, but that it was rude to reveal this trickery to guests, and so the bars were always embedded on the very bottoms of the platters. He learned that the practice of serving food in successive courses was adopted from the French, and that the reason it was not yet a universal norm was a lingering resentment over that little man Napoleon. He learned, but did not quite understand, the subtle distinctions between lunch, luncheon, and a noon dinner.",
    "One night Mrs Piper brought out a round, flat circle: some kind of baked dough that had been cut into triangular wedges. Robin took one and tentatively bit at the corner. It was very thick and floury, much denser than the fluffy white rolls his mother used to steam every week. It was not unpleasant, just surprisingly heavy. He took a large gulp of water to guide the bolus down, then asked, \u2018What\u2019s this?\u2019",
    "\u2018Why\u2019s it \u2013 why are they \u2013 called bannocks?\u2019 Robin asked. The sound of the word made him imagine a monster of the hills, some clawed and gristly thing that wouldn\u2019t be satisfied unless given a sacrifice of bread.",
    "He and Mrs Piper quickly bonded over a deep love of scones. She made them every which way \u2013 plain, served with a bit of clotted cream and raspberry jam; savoury and studded with cheese and garlic chives; or dotted through with bits of dried fruit. Robin liked them best plain \u2013 why ruin what was, in his opinion, perfect from conception? He had just learned about Platonic forms, and was convinced scones were the Platonic ideal of bread. And Mrs Piper\u2019s clotted cream was wonderful, light and nutty and refreshing all at once.",
    "Some households simmered milk for nearly a full day on the stove to get that layer of cream on top, she told him, but last Christmas Professor Lovell had brought her a clever silver-work contraption that could separate the cream in seconds..",
    "Robin didn\u2019t understand this joke, but he knew he didn\u2019t like sultanas in his scones; when Professor Lovell wasn\u2019t looking, he picked out his sultanas, slathered the denuded scone in clotted cream, and popped it in his mouth.",
    "He was never without a book, but he had to get creative in squeezing leisure reading into his schedule \u2013 he read at the table, scarfing down Mrs Piper\u2019s meals without a second thought to what he was putting in his mouth; he read while walking in the garden, though this made him dizzy; he even tried reading in the bath, but the wet, crumpled fingerprints he left on a new edition of Defoe\u2019s Colonel Jack shamed him enough to make him give up the practice..",
    "He enjoyed novels more than anything else. Dickens\u2019s serials were well and fun, but what a pleasure it was to hold the weight of an entire, finished story in his hands. He read any genre he could get his hands on. He enjoyed all of Jane Austen\u2019s oeuvre, though it took much consulting with Mrs Piper to understand the social conventions Austen described. (Where was Antigua? And why was Sir Thomas Bertram always going there?*) He devoured the travel literature of Thomas Hope and James Morier, through whom he met the Greeks and the Persians, or at least some fanciful version of them.",
    "Upon his return from Oxford that first term, Professor Lovell took Robin to a bookshop \u2013 Hatchards on Piccadilly, just opposite Fortnum & Mason. Robin paused outside the green-painted entrance, gaping. He\u2019d passed by bookshops many times during his jaunts about the city, but never had he imagined he might be allowed to go inside. He had somehow developed the idea that bookshops were only for wealthy grown-ups, that he\u2019d be dragged out by the ear if he dared to enter.",
    "Inside, the heady wood-dust smell of freshly printed books was overwhelming. If tobacco smelled like this, Robin thought, he\u2019d huff it every day. He stepped towards the closest shelf, hand lifted tentatively towards the books on display, too afraid to touch them \u2013 they seemed so new and crisp; their spines were uncracked, their pages smooth and bright. Robin was used to well-worn, waterlogged tomes; even his Classics grammars were decades old. These shiny, freshly bound things seemed like a different class of object, things to be admired from a distance rather than handled and read.",
    "Pick one? Just one, of all these treasures? Robin didn\u2019t know the first title from the second, and he was too dazzled by the sheer amount of text to flip through and decide. His eyes alighted on a title: The King\u2019s Own by Frederick Marryat, an author he was, so far, unfamiliar with. But new, he thought, was good.",
    "Outside, the professor handed him the brown-paper-wrapped parcel. Robin hugged it to his chest, willing himself not to rip it open until they\u2019d returned home. He thanked Professor Lovell profusely, and stopped only when he noticed this made the professor look somewhat uncomfortable. But then the professor asked him whether it felt good to hold the new book in his hands. Robin enthusiastically agreed and, for the first time he could remember, they traded smiles.",
    "Robin had planned to save The King\u2019s Own until that weekend, when he had a whole afternoon without classes to slowly savour its pages. But Thursday afternoon came, and he found he couldn\u2019t wait. After Mr Felton left, he wolfed down the plate of bread and cheese Mrs Piper had set out and hurried upstairs to the library, where he curled up in his favourite armchair and started to read.",
    "He was immediately enchanted. The King\u2019s Own was a tale of naval exploits; of revenge, daring, and struggle; of ship battles and far-flung travels. His mind drifted to his own voyage from Canton, and he reframed those memories in the context of the novel, imagined himself battling pirates, building rafts, winning medals for courage and valour\u2014",
    "Suddenly the library felt very cold; the golden afternoon darkened. Robin followed Professor Lovell\u2019s gaze to the ticking clock above the door. He\u2019d completely forgotten the time. But those hands couldn\u2019t possibly be right, it couldn\u2019t have been three hours since he\u2019d sat down to read.",
    "In years to come, whenever Robin looked back on that memory, he was appalled by how brazenly he had acted next. He must have been panicked out of his mind, because it was absurdly foolish, in retrospect, how he had simply closed the Marryat book and headed for the door, as if he could merely hurry down to class, as if a fault of this magnitude could be so easily forgotten.",
    "The force of the blow thrust him to the floor. He didn\u2019t register pain so much as shock; the reverberation in his temples didn\u2019t hurt, not yet \u2013 that came later, after several seconds passed and the blood began rushing to his head.",
    "Professor Lovell wasn\u2019t finished. As Robin rose to his knees, dazed, the professor pulled the poker from beside the fireplace and swung it diagonally against the right side of Robin\u2019s torso. Then he brought it down again. And again.",
    "Robin would have been more frightened if he\u2019d ever suspected Professor Lovell of violence, but this beating was so unexpected, so wholly out of character, that it felt surreal more than anything else. It didn\u2019t occur to him to beg, to cry, or even to scream. Even as the poker cracked against his ribs for the eighth, ninth, tenth, time \u2013 even as he tasted blood on his teeth \u2013 all he felt was a deep bewilderment that this was happening at all. It felt absurd. He seemed to be caught in a dream.",
    "Professor Lovell, too, did not look like a man in the throes of a tempestuous rage. He was not shouting; his eyes were not wild; his cheeks had not even turned red. He seemed simply, with every hard and deliberate blow, to be attempting to inflict maximum pain with the minimum risk of permanent injury. For he did not strike Robin\u2019s head, nor did he apply so much force that Robin\u2019s ribs would crack. No; he only dealt bruises that could be easily hidden and that, in time, would heal completely.",
    "After twelve strikes, it all stopped. With just as much poise and precision, Professor Lovell returned the poker to the mantel, stepped back, and sat down at the table, regarding Robin silently as the boy climbed to his knees and wiped the blood, as best he could, from his face.",
    "Robin\u2019s nose prickled. Tears threatened to burst forth, and he strained to hold them back. He felt as if a spike were being driven through his temples. He was so overcome with pain then that he could not breathe, and still it seemed the most important thing was to display no hint of suffering at all. He had never felt so wretched in his life. He wanted to die.",
    "\u2018I won\u2019t tolerate laziness under this roof,\u2019 said Professor Lovell. \u2018Translation is no easy occupation, Robin. It demands focus. Discipline. You are already at a disadvantage for your lack of an early education in Latin and Greek, and you\u2019ve only six years to make up the difference before you begin at Oxford. You cannot sloth. You cannot waste time on daydreams.\u2019",
    "He sighed. \u2018I hoped, based on Miss Slate\u2019s reports, that you had grown to be a diligent and hardworking boy. I see now that I was wrong. Laziness and deceit are common traits among your kind. This is why China remains an indolent and backwards country while her neighbours hurtle towards progress. You are, by nature, foolish, weak-minded, and disinclined to hard work. You must resist these traits, Robin. You must learn to overcome the pollution of your blood. I\u2019ve gambled greatly on your capacity to do so.",
    "He meant it. Even after this, even after the miseries of his classes, he could not imagine an alternate future for himself. Canton meant poverty, insignificance, and ignorance. Canton meant the plague. Canton meant no more books. London meant all the material comforts he could ask for. London meant, someday, Oxford.",
    "\u2018Then decide now, Robin. Dedicate yourself to excelling at your studies, make the sacrifices that entails, and promise me you will never embarrass me so much again. Or take the first packet home. You\u2019ll be back on the streets with no family, no skills, and no money. You\u2019ll never get the kinds of opportunities I\u2019m offering you again. You\u2019ll only ever dream of seeing London again, much less Oxford. You will never, ever touch a silver bar.\u2019 Professor Lovell leaned back, regarding Robin through cold, scrutinizing eyes. \u2018So. Choose.\u2019",
    "Somehow Robin made it through the entirety of that class, sniffling, too dazed to focus, a great bruise blooming on his face while his torso throbbed from a dozen invisible hurts. Mercifully, Mr Chester said nothing about the incident. Robin went through a list of conjugations and got all of them wrong. Mr Chester patiently corrected him in a pleasant if forcedly even tone. Robin\u2019s tardiness had not shortened the class \u2013 they went far past suppertime, and those were the longest three hours of Robin\u2019s life.",
    "The next morning, Professor Lovell acted as if nothing had happened. When Robin came down for breakfast, the professor asked if he\u2019d finished his translations. Robin said he had. Mrs Piper brought out eggs and ham for breakfast, and they ate in a somewhat frenzied silence. It hurt to chew, and at times to swallow \u2013 Robin\u2019s face had swollen even more overnight \u2013 but Mrs Piper only suggested he cut his ham into smaller pieces when he coughed. They all finished their tea. Mrs Piper cleared the plates away, and Robin went to retrieve his Latin textbooks before Mr Felton arrived.",
    "It never occurred to Robin to run, not then, and not once in the weeks that followed. Some other child might have been frightened, might have seized the first chance to escape into London\u2019s streets. Some other child suited to better, kinder treatment might have realized that such nonchalance on the part of adults like Mrs Piper, Mr Felton, and Mr Chester to a badly bruised eleven-year-old was frightfully wrong. But Robin was so grateful for this return to equilibrium that he couldn\u2019t find it in himself to even resent what had happened.",
    "After all, it never happened again. Robin made sure it did not. He spent the next six years studying to the point of exhaustion. With the threat of expatriation looming constantly above him, he devoted his life to becoming the student Professor Lovell wanted to see.",
    "Greek and Latin grew more entertaining after the first year, after he\u2019d assembled enough building blocks of each language to piece together fragments of meaning for himself. From then on it felt less like groping in the dark whenever he encountered a new text and more like filling in the blanks. Figuring out the precise grammatical formulation of a phrase that had been frustrating him gave him the same sort of satisfaction he derived from reshelving a book where it belonged or finding a missing sock \u2013 all the pieces fitted together, and everything was whole and complete.",
    "In Latin, he read through Cicero, Livy, Virgil, Horace, Caesar, and Juvenal; in Greek, he tackled Xenophon, Homer, Lysias, and Plato. In time, he realized he was quite good at languages. His memory was strong, and he had a knack for tones and rhythm. He soon reached a level of fluency in both Greek and Latin that any Oxford undergraduate would have been jealous of. In time, Professor Lovell stopped commenting on his inherited inclination to sloth, and instead nodded in approval at every update on Robin\u2019s rapid progress through the canon.",
    "History, meanwhile, marched on around them. In 1830, King George IV had died and was succeeded by his younger brother, William IV, the eternal compromiser who pleased no one. In 1831, another cholera epidemic swept through London, leaving thirty thousand dead in its wake.",
    "The brunt of its impact fell on the poor and the destitute; those living in close, cramped quarters who could not escape each other\u2019s tainted miasmas.* But the neighbourhood in Hampstead was untouched \u2013 to Professor Lovell and his friends in their remote walled estates, the epidemic was something to mention in passing, wince about in sympathy, and quickly forget..",
    "In 1833, a momentous thing happened \u2013 slavery was abolished in England and its colonies, to be replaced by a six-year apprenticeship term as a transition to freedom. Among Professor Lovell\u2019s interlocutors, this news was taken with the mild disappointment of a lost cricket match.",
    "\u2018Well, that\u2019s ruined the West Indies for us,\u2019 Mr Hallows complained. \u2018The abolitionists with their damned moralizing. I still believe this obsession with abolition is a product of the British needing to at least feel culturally superior now that they\u2019ve lost America. And on what grounds? It isn\u2019t as if those poor fellows aren\u2019t equally enslaved back in Africa under those tyrants they call kings.\u2019*",
    "\u2018You\u2019ve been reading too much of Smith. Hobart and MacQueen had the right idea \u2013 just smuggle in a ship full of Chinamen,* that\u2019ll do the trick. They\u2019re so very industrious and orderly, Richard should know\u2014\u2019",
    "\u2018Now, what I wish,\u2019 interrupted Mr Ratcliffe, \u2018is that all these women would stop taking part in those anti-slavery debates. They see too much of themselves in their situation; it puts ideas in their head.\u2019",
    "But if the world was an abstract object for them, it was even more abstract to him, for he had no stake in any of these matters. Robin processed that era through the myopic world of Lovell Manor. Reforms, colonial uprisings, slave revolts, women\u2019s suffrage, and the latest Parliamentary debates all meant nothing to him. All that mattered were the dead languages before him, and the fact that one day, a day that drew ever closer as the years trickled by, he would matriculate at the university he knew only from the painting on the wall \u2013 the city of knowledge, the city of dreaming spires.",
    "It all ended without circumstance, without celebration. One day Mr Chester told Robin as he packed up his books that he\u2019d enjoyed their lessons, and that he wished him well at university. This was how Robin discovered he was to be sent up to Oxford the next week.",
    "Supposedly there was an application process, some exchange of letters of introduction and guarantees of funding that secured his position. Robin was involved with none of this. Professor Lovell simply informed him he was due to move into his new lodgings on 29th September, so he\u2019d best have his bags packed by the evening of the 28th. \u2018You\u2019ll arrive a few days before the start of term. We\u2019ll ride up together.\u2019",
    "To his surprise, her eyes turned red at the corners. Her voice grew thick. \u2018Write home whenever you need a sack of victuals,\u2019 she said. \u2018I don\u2019t know much of what goes on inside those colleges, but I know their food is something awful.\u2019",
    "The next morning Robin and Professor Lovell took a cab to a station in central London, where they transferred to a stagecoach bound all the way for Oxford. As they waited to board, Robin entertained himself by trying to guess at the etymology of stagecoach. Coach was obvious, but why stage? Was it because the flat, wide carriage looked something like a stage? Because entire troupes of actors might have travelled thus, or performed atop one? But that was a stretch.",
    "\u2018Because the journey happens in stages,\u2019 Professor Lovell explained when Robin gave up. \u2018Horses don\u2019t want to run all the way from London to Oxford, and usually neither do we. But I detest travellers\u2019 inns, so we\u2019re doing the single-day run; it\u2019s about ten hours with no stops, so use that lavatory before we go.\u2019",
    "They shared their stagecoach with nine other passengers \u2013 a well-dressed little family of four and a group of slouching gentlemen in drab suits and elbow patches who Robin assumed were all professors. Robin sat squeezed between Professor Lovell and one of the suited men. It was too early for conversation. As the carriage bounced along the cobblestones, the passengers either dozed or stared blankly in various directions.",
    "Professor Lovell went back to sleep. The woman looked Robin up and down again with an unsettlingly eager curiosity, then turned her attention to her children. Robin remained silent. Suddenly his chest felt very tight, though he couldn\u2019t understand why this was.",
    "The children wouldn\u2019t stop staring at him; their eyes were wide and their mouths gaped in a way that would have been precious if they didn\u2019t make Robin feel as if he\u2019d sprouted another head. After a moment the boy tugged on his mother\u2019s sleeve and made her bend down so he could whisper in her ear.",
    "\u2018If you can see?\u2019 The woman raised her voice and overenunciated her every syllable, as if Robin had difficulty hearing. (This had happened often to Robin on the Countess of Harcourt; he could never understand why people treated those who couldn\u2019t understand English as if they were deaf.) \u2018With your eyes like that \u2013 can you see everything? Or is it only in little slits?\u2019",
    "The little family got off at Reading. Robin found he breathed more easily when they were gone. He could also stretch his legs over the aisle to give his stiff knees a respite without the mother shooting him a startled, suspicious look, as if she\u2019d caught him in the act of trying to pick her pockets.",
    "The last ten or so miles to Oxford were an idyllic stretch of green pastureland, punctuated by the occasional herd of cows. Robin tried reading a guidebook entitled The University of Oxford and Her Colleges, but found himself with a throbbing headache, and so began nodding off. Some stagecoaches were outfitted with silver-work to make the ride feel as smooth as skates on ice, but theirs was an older model, and the constant jostling was exhausting.",
    "Oxford was composed of twenty-two colleges, all with their own residential complexes, coats of arms, dining halls, customs, and traditions. Christ Church, Trinity, St John\u2019s, and All Souls boasted the largest endowments and therefore the nicest grounds. \u2018You\u2019ll want to make friends there, if only to have a look at the gardens,\u2019 said Professor Lovell. \u2018You can safely ignore anyone from Worcester or Hertford.",
    "They\u2019re poor and ugly,\u2019 whether he was referring to the people or the gardens, Robin couldn\u2019t be sure, \u2018and their food is bad.\u2019 One of the other gentlemen gave him a sour look as they stepped off the coach..",
    "Robin would live in University College. His guidebook informed him that it was commonly referred to as \u2018Univ\u2019, that it housed all students enrolled in the Royal Institute of Translation, and that in aesthetic it was \u2018sombre and venerable, a look befitting of the university\u2019s oldest daughter\u2019. It certainly looked like a Gothic sanctuary; its front wall was all turrets and uniform windows against smooth white stone.",
    "\u2018Well, here you are.\u2019 Professor Lovell stood with his hands shoved in his pockets, looking slightly uncomfortable. Now that they\u2019d been to the porter\u2019s lodge, acquired Robin\u2019s keys, and dragged Robin\u2019s trunks off High Street onto the paved sidewalk, it seemed obvious that a parting was imminent. Professor Lovell simply didn\u2019t know how to go about it. \u2018Well,\u2019 he said again. \u2018You have a few days before classes start, so you ought to spend them getting to know the city. You\u2019ve got a map \u2013 yes, there \u2013 though the place is small enough you\u2019ll learn it by heart after a few strolls.",
    "Perhaps seek out the members of your cohort; they\u2019ll likely have moved in by now. My residence here is up north in Jericho; I\u2019ve written you directions in that envelope. Mrs Piper will join me there next week, and we\u2019ll expect you at dinner the Saturday after next. She\u2019ll be very happy to see you.\u2019 All this he rattled off like a memorized checklist. He seemed to have a hard time looking Robin in the eyes. \u2018Are you all set?\u2019.",
    "They blinked at each other. Robin felt that surely there were other words that should be said, words to mark this occasion \u2013 his growing up, leaving home, his entering university \u2013 as momentous. But he couldn\u2019t imagine what they might be, and apparently neither could Professor Lovell.",
    "It was an awkward phrase to end on, two words that suggested more to come. Robin watched him for a moment, half expecting him to turn around, but Professor Lovell seemed focused solely on hailing a cab. Strange, yes. But this did not bother Robin. This was how things had always been between them: conversations unfinished, words best left unsaid.",
    "Robin\u2019s lodgings were in Number 4, Magpie Lane* \u2013 a green-painted building halfway down the crooked, narrow alley that connected High Street and Merton Street. Someone else was already standing at the front door, fiddling with the lock. He had to be a new student \u2013 satchels and trunks were scattered on the cobblestones around him.",
    "He was, Robin saw as he drew closer, very clearly not native to England. South Asia was more likely. Robin had seen sailors with the same colouring in Canton, all from ships arriving from India. The stranger had smooth dusky skin, a tall and graceful build, and the longest, darkest eyelashes that Robin had ever seen. His eyes flickered up and down Robin\u2019s frame before settling on his face, questioning \u2013 determining, Robin suspected, just how foreign Robin was in return.",
    "\u2018Ramiz Rafi Mirza,\u2019 the other boy pronounced proudly, extending his hand. He spoke with such proper English diction he sounded nearly like Professor Lovell. \u2018Or just Ramy, if you like. And you \u2013 you\u2019re here for the Translation Institute, aren\u2019t you?\u2019",
    "\u2018To Oxford, yes. To England, no \u2013 I came in through Liverpool on a ship four years ago and I\u2019ve been holed up in a big, boring estate in Yorkshire until now. My guardian wanted me to acclimatize to English society before I matriculated.\u2019",
    "Robin felt a strange, bursting feeling in his chest then. He\u2019d never met someone else in his situation, or anything like it, and he strongly suspected that should he keep probing, he would uncover a dozen more similarities. He had a thousand questions, but he didn\u2019t know where to start.",
    "Was Ramy also orphaned? Who was his sponsor? What was Calcutta like? Had he been back since? What brought him to Oxford? He was suddenly anxious \u2013 he felt his tongue stiffen, unable to choose a word \u2013 and there was also the matter of the keys, and their scattered trunks, which made the alley look as if a hurricane had emptied a ship\u2019s hold onto the street\u2014.",
    "Their quarters were across the hall from one another \u2013 rooms six and seven. Each unit consisted of a large bedroom and a sitting room equipped with a low table, empty bookshelves, and a couch. The couch and table both seemed too formal, so they sat cross-legged on the floor of Ramy\u2019s room, blinking like shy children as they regarded each other, unsure what to do with their hands.",
    "Ramy pulled a colourfully wrapped parcel from one of his trunks and set it on the floor between them. \u2018Sending-off gift from Sir Horace Wilson, my guardian. He gave me a bottle of port, too, but I threw that away. What would you like?\u2019 Ramy ripped the parcel open. \u2018There\u2019s toffee, caramel, peanut brittle, chocolates, and all kinds of candied fruits . . .\u2019",
    "\u2018Oh, goodness \u2013 I\u2019ll have some toffee, thank you.\u2019 Robin hadn\u2019t spoken to another person near his age in as long as he could remember.* He was only now realizing how badly he wanted a friend, but he didn\u2019t know how to make one, and the prospect of trying but failing suddenly terrified him. What if Ramy found him dull? Annoying? Oversolicitous?",
    "In the years to come, Robin would return so many times to this night. He was forever astonished by its mysterious alchemy, by how easily two badly socialized, restrictively raised strangers had transformed into kindred spirits in the span of minutes. Ramy seemed just as flushed and excited as Robin felt. They talked and talked. No topics seemed taboo; everything they brought up was either a point of instant agreement \u2013 scones are better without sultanas, thank you \u2013 or a cause for fascinating debate \u2013 no, London\u2019s lovely, actually; you country mice are just prejudiced because you\u2019re jealous.",
    "At some point they began reciting poems to each other \u2013 lovely chains of Urdu couplets Ramy told him were called ghazals, and Tang poetry which Robin frankly didn\u2019t love but which sounded impressive. And he so badly wanted to impress Ramy. He was so witty, so well-read and funny.",
    "He had sharp, scathing opinions on everything \u2013 British cuisine, British manners, and the Oxbridge rivalry (\u2018Oxford is larger than Cambridge, but Cambridge is prettier, and anyhow I think they only established Cambridge as overflow for the mediocre talent.\u2019) He\u2019d travelled half the world; he\u2019d been to Lucknow, Madras, Lisbon, Paris, and Madrid. He described his native India as a paradise: \u2018The mangoes, Birdie\u2019 (he\u2019d already started calling Robin \u2018Birdie\u2019), \u2018they\u2019re ridiculously juicy, you can\u2019t buy anything similar on this sorry little island. It\u2019s been years since I\u2019ve had one.",
    "\u2018That\u2019s a terrible translation.\u2019 Ramy waved his arm. \u2018Throw it away. For one thing, it\u2019s not even a direct translation \u2013 it went into French first, and then English \u2013 and for another, it\u2019s not remotely like the original. What\u2019s more, Galland \u2013 Antoine Galland, the French translator \u2013 did his very best to Frenchify the dialogue and to erase all cultural details he thought would confuse the reader. He translates Haroun Alraschid\u2019s concubines as dames ses favourites. Favourite ladies.",
    "How do you get \u201cfavourite ladies\u201d from \u201cconcubines\u201d? And he entirely cuts out some of the more erotic passages, and injects cultural explanations whenever he feels like it \u2013 tell me, how would you like to read an epic with a doddering Frenchman breathing down your neck at all the raunchy bits?\u2019.",
    "Ramy gesticulated wildly as he spoke. It was clear he wasn\u2019t truly angry, just passionate and clearly brilliant, so invested in the truth he needed the whole world to know. Robin leaned back and watched Ramy\u2019s lovely, agitated face, both amazed and delighted.",
    "When at last they grew too sleepy to finish their sentences, the sweets were half-gone and Ramy\u2019s floor was littered with wrappers. Yawning, they waved each other good night. Robin tripped back to his own quarters, swung the door shut, then turned around to face his empty rooms. This was his home for the next four years \u2013 the bed under the low, sloping ceiling where he would wake every morning, the leaking tap over the sink where he would wash his face, and the desk in the corner that he would hunch over every evening, scribbling by candlelight until wax dripped onto the floorboards.",
    "For the first time since he\u2019d arrived at Oxford, it struck him that he was to make a life here. He imagined it stretched out before him: the gradual accumulation of books and trinkets in those spare bookshelves; the wear and tear of those crisp new linen shirts still packed in his trunks, the change of seasons seen and heard through the wind-rattled window above his bed that wouldn\u2019t quite shut. And Ramy, right across the hall.",
    "The bed was unmade, but he was too tired now to fiddle with the sheets or search for covers, so he curled up on his side and pulled his coat over him. In a very short while he was fast asleep and smiling.",
    "These were three of the happiest days of Robin\u2019s life. He had no readings or classes; no recitations or compositions to prepare. For the first time in his life he was in full control of his own purse and schedule, and he went mad with freedom.",
    "They spent their first day shopping. They went to Ede & Ravenscroft to be fitted for gowns; to Thornton\u2019s Bookshop for the entirety of their course list; to the home-goods stands at Cornmarket for teapots, spoons, bed linens, and Argand lamps. After acquiring everything they assumed necessary for student life, they both found they had a generous fraction of their stipends left over, with no danger of running out \u2013 their scholarship allowed them to withdraw the same amount from the bursary every month.",
    "So they were profligate. They bought bags of candied nuts and caramels. They rented the college punts and spent the afternoon driving each other into the Cherwell\u2019s banks. They went to the Queen\u2019s Lane coffeehouse, at which they spent a ridiculous amount of money on a variety of pastries neither of them had ever tried. Ramy was very fond of flapjacks \u2013 \u2018They make oats taste so good,\u2019 he said, \u2018I understand the joys of being a horse,\u2019 \u2013 while Robin preferred sticky sweet buns so drenched in sugar they made his teeth ache for hours.",
    "In Oxford, they stuck out like sore thumbs. This rattled Robin at first. In London, which was slightly more cosmopolitan, foreigners never drew such prolonged stares. But Oxford\u2019s townsfolk seemed constantly startled by their presence. Ramy attracted more attention than Robin did. Robin was foreign only when viewed up close and in certain lights, but Ramy was immediately, visibly other.",
    "\u2018Oh, yes,\u2019 he said, when the baker asked if he was from Hindustan, speaking in an exaggerated accent Robin had never heard before. \u2018I\u2019ve got quite a big family there. Don\u2019t tell anyone, but I\u2019m actually royalty, fourth in line to the throne \u2013 what throne? Oh, just a regional one; our political system is very complicated. But I wanted to experience a normal life \u2013 get a proper British education, you know \u2013 so I\u2019ve left my palace for here.\u2019",
    "\u2018Whenever the English see me, they try to determine what kind of story they know me from,\u2019 Ramy said. \u2018Either I\u2019m a dirty thieving lascar, or I\u2019m a servant in some nabob\u2019s house. And I realized in Yorkshire that it\u2019s easier if they think I\u2019m a Mughal prince.\u2019",
    "\u2018But that\u2019s impossible for me,\u2019 said Ramy. \u2018I have to play a part. Back in Calcutta, we all tell the story of Sake Dean Mahomed, the first Muslim from Bengal to become a rich man in England. He has a white Irish wife. He owns property in London. And you know how he did it? He opened a restaurant, which failed; and then he tried to be hired as a butler or valet, which also failed. And then he had the brilliant idea of opening a shampoo house in Brighton.\u2019 Ramy chuckled. \u2018Come and get your healing vapours! Be massaged with Indian oils! It cures asthma and rheumatism; it heals paralysis.",
    "Of course, we don\u2019t believe that at home. But all Dean Mahomed had to do was give himself some medical credentials, convince the world of this magical Oriental cure, and then he had them eating out of the palm of his hand. So what does that tell you, Birdie? If they\u2019re going to tell stories about you, use it to your advantage. The English are never going to think I\u2019m posh, but if I fit into their fantasy, then they\u2019ll at least think I\u2019m royalty.\u2019.",
    "That marked the difference between them. Ever since his arrival in London, Robin had tried to keep his head down and assimilate, to play down his otherness. He thought the more unremarkable he seemed, the less attention he would draw. But Ramy, who had no choice but to stand out, had decided he might as well dazzle. He was bold to the extreme. Robin found him incredible and a little bit terrifying.",
    "That evening they paid far too much money for a hamper of rolls, cheese, and sweet grapes, which they brought to a hill in South Park on the eastern part of campus for a picnic. They found a quiet spot near a thicket of trees, secluded enough that Ramy could conduct his sunset prayer, and sat cross-legged on the grass, pulling bread apart with their bare hands, interrogating each other about their lives with the eager fascination of boys who, for many years, thought they were the only ones in their particular situation.",
    "Ramy deduced very quickly that Professor Lovell was Robin\u2019s father. \u2018Has to be, right? Otherwise, why\u2019s he so cagey about it? And otherwise to that otherwise, how\u2019d he come to know your mother? Does he know that you know, or is he really still trying to hide it?\u2019",
    "Ramy was far more open about his own background. He had spent the first thirteen years of his life in Calcutta, the older brother to three younger sisters in a family employed by a wealthy nabob named Sir Horace Wilson, and the next four in a Yorkshire countryside estate as a consequence of impressing Wilson, reading Greek and Latin, and trying not to claw out his eyes from boredom.",
    "\u2018Lucky you got your education in London,\u2019 Ramy said. \u2018At least you had somewhere to go at the weekends. My whole adolescence was hills and moors, and not a single person under forty in sight. Did you ever see the King?\u2019",
    "\u2018William? No, not really, he doesn\u2019t come out in public much. Especially recently, what with the Factory Act and the Poor Law \u2013 the reformers were always rioting in the streets, it wouldn\u2019t have been safe.\u2019",
    "From their vantage point at South Park they could look over the whole of the university, draped in a golden blanket at sunset. The light made Ramy\u2019s eyes glow, made his skin shine like burnished bronze. Robin had the absurd impulse to place his hand against Ramy\u2019s cheek; indeed, he\u2019d half lifted up his arm before his mind caught up with his body.",
    "They introduced themselves as they moved in: Colin Thornhill, a wide-eyed and effusive solicitor-in-training who talked only in full paragraphs and about himself; Bill Jameson, an affable redhead studying to be a surgeon who seemed perpetually worried about how much things cost; and at the end of the hall, a pair of twin brothers, Edgar and Edward Sharp, who were second years nominally pursuing an education in the Classics but who, as they loudly proclaimed, were more \u2018just interested in the social aspect until we come into our inheritances.\u2019.",
    "On Saturday night, they congregated for drinks in the common room adjoining the shared kitchen. Bill, Colin, and the Sharps were all seated around the low table when Ramy and Robin walked in. They\u2019d been told to come at nine, but the wine had clearly been flowing for a while \u2013 empty bottles littered the floor around them, and the Sharp brothers were slouched against each other, both visibly drunk.",
    "Colin was holding forth on the differences between the student gowns. \u2018You can tell everything about a man from his gown,\u2019 he said importantly. He had a peculiar, overpronounced, suspiciously exaggerated accent that Robin couldn\u2019t place but quite disliked. \u2018The bachelor\u2019s gown loops at the elbow and terminates at a point. The gentleman-commoner\u2019s gown is silk and plaited at the sleeves. The commoner\u2019s gown has no sleeves, and has plaits at the shoulder, and you can tell the servitors and the commoners apart because their gowns don\u2019t have plaits, and their caps don\u2019t have tassels\u2014\u2019",
    "\u2018Oh, but proper academic dress is of the utmost importance,\u2019 Colin insisted. \u2018It\u2019s how we display our status as Oxford men. It\u2019s considered one of the seven deadly sins to wear an ordinary tweed cap with a gown, or to use a walking stick with a gown. And I once heard of a fellow who, not knowing the kinds of gowns, told the tailor he was a scholar, so of course he needed a scholar\u2019s gown, only to be laughed out of hall the next day when it transpired that he was not a scholar, for he\u2019d won no scholarship, but merely a paying commoner\u2014\u2019",
    "\u2018They take gowns very seriously here,\u2019 Colin said solemnly. \u2018I read it in my guidebook. They won\u2019t even let you into lectures if you\u2019re not in the proper attire. So are you a gentleman-commoner or a servitor?\u2019",
    "\u2018So what are you, anyway?\u2019 Edgar Sharp asked abruptly. He\u2019d seemed on the verge of falling asleep, but now he made a mighty effort to sit up, squinting as if trying to see Ramy through a fog. \u2018A Negro? A Turk?\u2019",
    "Any hopes of fraternity fizzled out quite quickly after that. A round of whist was proposed, but the Sharp brothers did not know the rules and were too drunk to learn. Bill begged a headache and left for bed early. Colin went on another long tirade about the intricacies of hall etiquette, including the very long Latin grace he suggested they all learn by heart that night, but no one listened. The Sharp brothers, in a strange show of contrition, then asked Robin and Ramy some polite if inane questions about translation, but it was clear they were not too interested in the answers.",
    "They spent their third day together touring the jewels of the university. Oxford in 1836 was in an era of becoming, an insatiable creature feeding on the wealth which it bred. The colleges were constantly renovating; buying up more land from the city; replacing medieval buildings with newer, lovelier halls; constructing new libraries to house recently acquired collections. Almost every building in Oxford had a name \u2013 derived not from function or location, but from the wealthy and powerful individual who inspired its creation.",
    "There was the massive, imposing Ashmolean Museum, which housed the cabinet of curiosities donated by Elias Ashmole, including a dodo\u2019s head, hippopotamus skulls, and a three-inch-long sheep\u2019s horn that was supposed to have grown out of the head of an old woman in Cheshire named Mary Davis; the Radcliffe Library, a domed library that somehow appeared even larger and grander from the inside than from the outside; and the Sheldonian Theatre, ringed by massive stone busts known as the Emperor Heads, all of whom looked like ordinary men who had stumbled upon Medusa..",
    "And there was the Bodleian \u2013 oh, the Bodleian, a national treasure in its own right: home of the largest collection of manuscripts in England (\u2018Cambridge has only got a hundred thousand titles,\u2019 sniffed the clerk who admitted them, \u2018and Edinburgh\u2019s only got a paltry sixty-three\u2019), whose collection only continued to expand under the proud leadership of the Reverend Doctor Bulkeley Bandinel, who had a book-buying budget of nearly \u00a32,000 a year.",
    "It was the Reverend Doctor Bandinel himself who came to greet them on their first tour of their library and guided them to the Translators\u2019 Reading Room. \u2018Couldn\u2019t let a clerk do it,\u2019 he sighed. \u2018Normally we let the fools wander about on their own and ask around for directions if they get lost. But you translators \u2013 you truly appreciate what\u2019s going on here.\u2019",
    "He was a heavy-set man with droopy eyes and a similarly droopy demeanour whose mouth seemed permanently slumped in a frown. Yet as he moved through the building, his eyes lit up with genuine pleasure. \u2018We\u2019ll start in the main wings, then traipse over to the Duke Humphreys. Follow along, feel free to have a look \u2013 books are meant to be touched, otherwise they\u2019re useless, so don\u2019t be nervous. We\u2019re quite proud of our last few major acquisitions.",
    "There\u2019s the Richard Gough map collection donated in 1809 \u2013 the British Museum didn\u2019t want them, can you believe it? And then the Malone donation ten or so years ago \u2013 it greatly expanded our Shakespearean materials. Oh, and just two years ago, we received the Francis Douce collection \u2013 that\u2019s thirteen thousand volumes in French and English, though I suppose neither of you is specializing in French . . . Arabic? Oh, yes \u2013 right this way; the Institute has the bulk of Arabic materials at Oxford, but I\u2019ve got some poetry volumes from Egypt and Syria that may interest you . . .\u2019.",
    "They left the Bodleian dazed, impressed, and a bit intimidated by the sheer amount of material at their disposal. Ramy made an imitation of Reverend Doctor Bandinel\u2019s hanging jowls, but could summon no real malice; it was difficult to disdain a man who so clearly adored the accumulation of knowledge for knowledge\u2019s sake.",
    "They ended the day with a tour of University College by Billings, a senior porter. It turned out that thus far they had seen only a small corner of their new home. The college, which lay just to the east of the houses on Magpie Lane, boasted two green quadrangle courtyards and an arrangement of stone buildings that resembled castle keeps. As they walked, Billings rattled off a list of namesakes and biographies of those namesakes, including donors, architects, and otherwise significant figures. \u2018 . . .",
    "now, the statues over the entrances are of Queen Anne and Queen Mary, and in the interior, James II and Dr Radcliffe . . . And those brilliant painted windows in the chapel were done by Abraham van Linge in 1640, yes, they\u2019ve held up very well, and the glass painter Henry Giles of York did the east window . . . There\u2019s no service on, so we can take a poke around inside; follow me.\u2019.",
    "They knew. Robin and Ramy both had been hearing the name constantly since their arrival at Oxford. The bas-relief was a memorial to the University College alum and widely recognized genius who in 1786 published a foundational text identifying Proto-Indo-European as a predecessor language linking Latin, Sanskrit, and Greek. He was now perhaps the single best-known translator on the continent, save for his nephew, the recently graduated Sterling Jones.",
    "\u2018It\u2019s Sir William Jones.\u2019 Robin found the scene depicted in the frieze somewhat discomfiting. Jones was positioned at a writing desk, one leg crossed pertly over the other, while three figures, clearly meant to be Indians, sat submissively on the floor before him like children receiving a lesson.",
    "Billings looked proud. \u2018That\u2019s right. Here he is translating a digest on the Hindu laws, and there are some Brahmins on the floor to assist him. We are, I believe, the only college whose walls are graced with Indians. But then Univ has always had a special link to the colonies.* And those tigers\u2019 heads, as you know, are emblematic of Bengal.\u2019",
    "They spent Sunday night in the depths of the Bodleian bookcases. They\u2019d been assigned a reading list upon registration, but both, faced with a sudden deluge of freedom, had left it off until the last possible moment. The Bodleian was supposed to close by 8.00 p.m. on weekends. They reached its doors at 7.45 p.m., but mention of the Translation Institute seemed to hold immense power, for when Ramy explained what they needed, the clerks told them they could stay as late as they liked. The doors would be unlocked for the night staff; they could leave at their own convenience.",
    "By the time they emerged from the stacks, satchels heavy with books and eyes dizzy from squinting at tiny fonts, the sun had long gone down. At night, the moon conspired with streetlamps to bathe the city in a faint, otherworldly glow. The cobblestones beneath their feet seemed like roads leading into and out of different centuries. This could be the Oxford of the Reformation, or the Oxford of the Middle Ages. They moved within a timeless space, shared by the ghosts of scholars past.",
    "The journey back to college took less than five minutes, but they detoured up and around Broad Street to lengthen their walk. This was the first time they\u2019d been out so late; they wanted to savour the city at night. They moved in silence, neither daring to break the spell.",
    "A burst of laughter drifted from across the stone walls when they passed New College. As they turned down Holywell Lane, they saw a group of six or seven students, all garbed in black gowns, though from the sway of their walk they must have just departed not from a lecture but from a pub.",
    "They\u2019d been three days at University College, but they\u2019d already learned the intercollegiate pecking order and associated stereotypes. Exeter was genteel but unintellectual; Brasenose was rowdy and lush with wine. Their neighbouring Queen\u2019s and Merton were safely ignored. Balliol boys, who paid near the highest tuitions at the University, next to Oriel, were better known for running up the tab than for showing up for their tutorials.",
    "The street was wide, and the two groups were walking on opposite sides. They would have passed each other without commotion, except that one of the boys pointed suddenly at Ramy and shouted, \u2018What\u2019s that? Did you see that?\u2019",
    "\u2018Hold it,\u2019 said the boy called Mark. He shrugged his friends off. He stood still on the street, squinting at Ramy with drunken concentration. His hand hung in midair, still pointing. \u2018Look at his face \u2013 you see it?\u2019",
    "He hated it as he did so, he felt like such a coward, but it was the only act he could imagine that didn\u2019t end in catastrophe. For he knew that Ramy, shocked, would follow. Indeed \u2013 seconds later he heard Ramy\u2019s footsteps behind him, his hard breathing, the curses he muttered under his breath as they sprinted down Holywell.",
    "The laughter \u2013 for there was laughter again, though it was no longer born of mirth \u2013 seemed to amplify behind them. The Balliol boys hooted like monkeys; their cackles stretched alongside their shadows against the brick walls. For a moment Robin was terrified they were being chased, that the boys were hot on their heels, footsteps hammering all around them. But it was only the blood thundering in his ears. The boys had not followed them; they were too drunk, too easily amused, and certainly, by now, distracted in pursuit of their next entertainment.",
    "\u2018In the Bod.\u2019 Ramy pressed his fingertips against the bridge of his nose and groaned. \u2018I know where \u2013 right on the corner of the desk; I was going to place it on top because I didn\u2019t want the pages crumpled, only I got so tired I must have forgotten.\u2019",
    "There was no fight in his voice. They both knew what Robin would not say out loud \u2013 that Robin, at least, could pass for white in the dark, and that if Robin came across the Balliol boys alone, they wouldn\u2019t give him a second glance.",
    "Oxford took on a sinister air now that he was alone; the lights were no longer warm but eerie, stretching and warping his shadow against the cobblestones. The Bodleian was locked, but a night clerk noticed him waving at the window and let him in. He was, thankfully, one of the staff from before, and he let Robin into the west wing without question. The Reading Room was pitch-black and freezing. All the lamps were off; Robin could only just see by the moonlight streaming in at the far end of the room. Shivering, he snatched Ramy\u2019s notebook, shoved it into his satchel, and hurried out the door.",
    "He should have quickened his pace, but something \u2013 the tones, the shape of the words \u2013 compelled him to stop. Only after he\u2019d paused to strain his ears did he realize he was listening to Chinese. One Chinese phrase, uttered over and over again with increasing urgency.",
    "There were three people in the middle of Holywell Street, all slim youths dressed entirely in black, two men and a woman. They were struggling with a trunk. The bottom must have dropped out, because what were unmistakably silver bars were strewn across the cobblestones.",
    "All three glanced up as Robin approached. The man whispering furiously in Chinese had his back to Robin; he turned around last, only after his associates had gone stock-still. He met Robin\u2019s eyes. Robin\u2019s heart caught in his throat.",
    "Robin realized instantly what he was trying to do. W\u00fax\u00edng \u2013 in Chinese, \u2018formless, shapeless, incorporeal\u2019.* The closest English translation was \u2018invisible\u2019. These people, whoever they were, were trying to hide. But something had gone wrong, for the silver bar was only barely working; the three youths\u2019 images flickered under the streetlamp, and occasionally they seemed translucent, but they were decidedly not hidden.",
    "Robin didn\u2019t know what it was that compelled him to act \u2013 the recent terror of the Balliol boys, the utter absurdity of this scene, or the disorienting sight of his doppelg\u00e4nger\u2019s face \u2013 but he stepped forward and put his hand on the bar. His doppelg\u00e4nger relinquished it without a word.",
    "No, disappeared was not quite the word for it. Robin didn\u2019t have the words for it; it was lost in translation, a concept that neither the Chinese nor the English could fully describe. They existed, but in no human form. They were not merely beings that couldn\u2019t be seen. They weren\u2019t beings at all. They were shapeless. They drifted, expanded; they were the air, the brick walls, the cobblestones. Robin had no awareness of his body, where he ended and the bar began \u2013 he was the silver, the stones, the night.",
    "Robin dropped the bar. He couldn\u2019t maintain his hold on it; he was barely aware of its presence anymore. He didn\u2019t so much as use his hand and open his fingers as he did violently thrust the bar away to try to separate his essence from the silver.",
    "The absurdity of this had not yet sunk in. Dimly he realized that whatever was happening had to be very illegal. These youths could not be associated with Oxford, the Bodleian, or the Translation Institute, or else they wouldn\u2019t be skulking about at midnight, clad in black and hiding from the police.",
    "But somehow, helping seemed the only option. He didn\u2019t question this logic, he simply acted. It felt like falling into a dream, like stepping into a play where he already knew his lines, though everything else was a mystery. This was an illusion with its own internal logic, and for some reason he couldn\u2019t quite name, he didn\u2019t want to break it.",
    "They were startlingly fast. Just seconds later, the street was empty. They\u2019d left no trace they\u2019d ever been there \u2013 they\u2019d picked up every last bar, had even run away with the broken ruins of the trunk. They could have been ghosts. Robin could have imagined this entire encounter, and the world would have looked no different at all.",
    "There was no question about what had happened. They were both shaken by the sudden realization that they did not belong in this place, that despite their affiliation with the Translation Institute and despite their gowns and pretensions, their bodies were not safe on the streets. They were men at Oxford; they were not Oxford men. But the enormity of this knowledge was so devastating, such a vicious antithesis to the three golden days they\u2019d blindly enjoyed, that neither of them could say it out loud.",
    "So the Lord scattered them abroad from there over the face of all the earth, and they left off building the city. Therefore its name was called Babel, because there the Lord confused the language of all the earth; and from there the Lord scattered them abroad over the face of all the earth.",
    "Sleep felt impossible. Robin kept seeing the face of his doppelg\u00e4nger floating in the dark. Had he, fatigued and rattled, imagined the whole thing? But the streetlamps had shone so brightly, and his twin\u2019s features \u2013 his fear, his panic \u2013 were so sharply etched into his memory. He knew it was not a projection. It had not quite felt like looking into a mirror, where all his features were reflected backwards, a false representation of what the world saw, but a gut recognition of sameness. Whatever was in that man\u2019s face was in his as well.",
    "He was only beginning to fathom the weight of his actions. He\u2019d stolen from the university. Was it a test? Stranger rituals were practised at Oxford. Had he passed or failed? Or would constables come banging on his door the next morning and ask him to leave?",
    "But I can\u2019t be sent down, he thought. I\u2019ve only just got here. Suddenly the delights of Oxford \u2013 the warmth of his bed, the smell of new books and new clothes \u2013 made him squirm in discomfort, for now all he could think about was how soon he might lose it all. He tossed and turned in sweaty sheets, conjuring up more and more detailed visions of how the morning might go \u2013 how the constables would pull him from his bed, how they\u2019d shackle his wrists and drag him to the gaol, how Professor Lovell would sternly ask Robin never to contact him or Mrs Piper again.",
    "This was a shock. Robin and Ramy had both grown up in sterile, isolated environments, kept far away from girls their own age. The feminine was an idea that existed in theory, the stuff of novels or a rare phenomenon to be glimpsed from across the street. The best description Robin knew of women came from a treatise he\u2019d once flipped through by a Mrs Sarah Ellis,* which labelled girls \u2018gentle, inoffensive, delicate, and passively amiable\u2019.",
    "\u2018The university has asked us to dress like this so as to not upset or distract the young gentlemen,\u2019 the Black girl explained. Her English carried a faint accent, which Robin thought resembled French, though he wasn\u2019t sure. She shook her left leg at him, displaying trousers so crisp and stiff they looked like they\u2019d been purchased yesterday. \u2018Not every faculty is as liberal as the Translation Institute, you see.\u2019",
    "They were saved from further conversation by a tall, slender Black man who shook all their hands and introduced himself as Anthony Ribben, a postgraduate specializing in French, Spanish, and German. \u2018My guardian fancied himself a Romanticist,\u2019 he explained. \u2018He hoped I\u2019d follow his passion for poetry, but when it became apparent I had more than just a passing talent for languages, he had me sent here.\u2019",
    "\u2018That doesn\u2019t go away.\u2019 Anthony headed towards the tower, gesturing for them to follow. \u2018Especially once you\u2019ve gone through these doors. They\u2019ve asked me to show you about the Institute until eleven, and then I\u2019ll leave you with Professor Playfair. Will this be your first time inside?\u2019",
    "They gazed up at the tower. It was a magnificent building \u2013 a gleaming white edifice built in the neoclassical style, eight storeys tall and ringed with ornamental pillars and high stained-glass windows. It dominated the skyline of High Street, and made the nearby Radcliffe Library and University Church of St Mary the Virgin look quite pathetic in comparison. Ramy and Robin had walked past it countless times over the weekend, marvelling at it together, but always from a distance. They hadn\u2019t dared approach. Not then.",
    "\u2018Why they call us Babblers?\u2019 Anthony nodded. \u2018A joke as old as the Institute itself. But some first year at Balliol thinks he conceived it for the first time every September, and so we\u2019ve been doomed to that unwieldy moniker for decades.\u2019",
    "He strode briskly up the front steps. At the top a blue and gold seal was carved into the stone before the door, the Oxford University coat of arms. Dominus illuminatio mea, it read. The Lord is my light. The moment Anthony\u2019s foot touched the seal, the heavy wooden door swung out on its own accord, revealing a golden, lamplit interior of staircases, bustling dark-robed scholars, and books upon books upon books.",
    "Robin paused, too dazzled to follow. Of all the marvels of Oxford, Babel seemed the most impossible \u2013 a tower out of time, a vision from a dream. Those stained-glass windows, that high, imposing dome; it all seemed to have been pulled straight from the painting in Professor Lovell\u2019s dining room and dropped whole onto this drab grey street. An illumination in a medieval manuscript; a door to a fairy land. It seemed impossible that they should come here every day to study, that they had the right to enter at all.",
    "\u2018Translation agencies have always been indispensable tools of \u2013 nay, the centres of \u2013 great civilizations. In 1527, Charles V of Spain created the Secretar\u00eda de Interpretaci\u00f3n de Lenguas, whose employees juggled over a dozen languages in service of governing his empire\u2019s territories.",
    "The Royal Institute of Translation was founded in London in the early seventeenth century, though it didn\u2019t move to its current home in Oxford until 1715 and the end of the War of the Spanish Succession, after which the British decided it might be prudent to train young lads to speak the languages of the colonies the Spanish had just lost. Yes, I\u2019ve memorized all this, and no, I didn\u2019t write it, but I\u2019ve been giving this tour since my first year on account of my immense personal charisma, so I\u2019ve got quite good at it. Through the foyer this way.\u2019.",
    "Anthony had the rare skill of talking smoothly while walking backwards. \u2018There\u2019s eight floors to Babel,\u2019 he said. \u2018The Book of Jubilees claims the historical Tower of Babel reached a height of over five thousand cubits \u2013 that\u2019s nearly two miles \u2013 which is of course impossible, though our Babel is the tallest building in Oxford, and likely all of England, excepting St Paul\u2019s. We\u2019re nearly three hundred feet tall, not counting the basement, which means our total height is twice that of the Radcliffe Library\u2014\u2019",
    "\u2018Larger on the inside than it seems on the outside?\u2019 Anthony asked. \u2018Indeed.\u2019 Robin had not noticed this at first, but now felt disoriented by the contradiction. Babel\u2019s exterior was massive, but it still did not appear tall enough to admit the high ceilings and towering shelves of each interior floor. \u2018It\u2019s a pretty trick of silver-working, though I\u2019m not sure of the match-pair involved. It\u2019s been like this since I got here; we take it for granted.\u2019",
    "Anthony guided them through a throng of townsfolk standing in busy queues before cashier windows. \u2018We\u2019re in the lobby now \u2013 all business gets conducted here. Local tradesmen ordering bars for their equipment, city officials requesting public works maintenance, that sort of thing. It\u2019s the only area of the tower accessible to civilians, though they don\u2019t interact with scholars much \u2013 we\u2019ve got clerks to process their requests.\u2019 Anthony waved for them to follow him up the central staircase. \u2018This way.\u2019",
    "\u2018It\u2019s always busy here,\u2019 said Anthony. \u2018International treaties, overseas trade, that sort of thing. The gears of empire, the stuff that makes the world go round. Most Babel students end up here after graduation, as the pay is good and they\u2019re always hiring. They do quite a lot of pro bono work here, too \u2013 the whole southwest quadrant is a team working on translating the Code Napol\u00e9on into other European languages.* But we charge a pretty penny for the rest. This is the floor that draws the largest income \u2013 except silver-working, of course.\u2019",
    "Anthony led them up another flight of stairs. \u2018The third floor is the landing base for the live interpreters.\u2019 He gestured around the largely empty room, which showed few signs of use except for several stained teacups lying askew and the occasional stack of paper on a desk corner. \u2018They\u2019re almost never here, but they need a place to prepare briefing files in confidence when they are, so they get this entire space. They accompany dignitaries and foreign service officials on their trips abroad, attending balls in Russia and taking tea with sheikhs in Arabia and whatnot.",
    "I\u2019m told all the travel gets quite exhausting, so there aren\u2019t too many career interpreters who come out of Babel. They\u2019re usually natural polyglots who picked up their languages elsewhere \u2013 they had missionary parents, or they spent summers with foreign relatives, for example. Babel graduates tend to avoid it.\u2019.",
    "\u2018It\u2019s a cushy posting if what you want is to travel abroad on someone else\u2019s money,\u2019 said Anthony. \u2018But academics by nature are a solitary, sedentary lot. Travel sounds fun until you realize what you really want is to stay at home with a cup of tea and a stack of books by a warm fire.\u2019",
    "\u2018I have a view informed by experience. You\u2019ll understand in time. Alums who apply for interpreting jobs always quit within the first two years. Even Sterling Jones \u2013 Sir William Jones\u2019s nephew, mind you \u2013 couldn\u2019t hack it for more than eight months, and they had him travelling first class wherever he went. Anyway, live interpretation isn\u2019t considered all that glamorous, because all that really matters is that you get your basic points across without offending anyone. You don\u2019t get to play around with the intricacies of language, which is of course where the real fun is.\u2019",
    "\u2018Literature,\u2019 Anthony explained. \u2018That is, the businesses of translating foreign novels, stories, and poems into English and \u2013 less frequently \u2013 vice versa. It\u2019s a bit low on the prestige rung, to be honest, but it\u2019s a more coveted placement than interpretation. One considers a postgraduation appointment to Literature the natural first step towards becoming a Babel professor.\u2019",
    "\u2018Yes, greedy,\u2019 he said, with absolutely no malice. \u2018You\u2019ll find our book-buying budget is effectively limitless, and our librarians like to maintain a thorough collection. Though we can\u2019t translate everything that comes through here; we just haven\u2019t the manpower. Translating ancient texts still occupies a good part of our time.\u2019",
    "\u2018Bettering one\u2019s understanding of the human condition is not a matter of profit.\u2019 Vimal sniffed. \u2018We\u2019re always updating the classics \u2013 between the past century and now, we\u2019ve become a lot better at certain languages, and there\u2019s no reason why classics should remain so inaccessible. I\u2019m currently working on a better Latin version of the Bhagavad Gita\u2014\u2019",
    "\u2018Over ten years ago,\u2019 Vimal dismissed. \u2018And the Schlegel Gita is dreadful; he said himself that he hadn\u2019t grasped the basic philosophy that underlies the whole thing. Which shows, because he\u2019s used about seven different words for yoga\u2014\u2019",
    "\u2018Me, no.\u2019 Anthony chuckled. \u2018I\u2019m here for silver-working. I think the Literature Department are an indulgent lot, as Vimal knows. See, the sad thing is, they could be the most dangerous scholars of them all, because they\u2019re the ones who really understand languages \u2013 know how they live and breathe and how they can make our blood pump, or our skin prickle, with just a turn of phrase. But they\u2019re too obsessed fiddling with their lovely images to bother with how all that living energy might be channelled into something far more powerful. I mean, of course, silver.\u2019",
    "The fifth and sixth floors housed both instruction rooms and reference materials \u2013 the primers, grammars, readers, thesauruses, and at least four different editions of every dictionary published in what Anthony claimed was every language spoken in the world.",
    "\u2018Well, the dictionaries are really scattered all over the tower, but here\u2019s where you come if you need to do some archival heavy lifting,\u2019 Anthony explained. \u2018Right in the middle, you see, so no one ever has to walk more than four flights to get what they need.\u2019",
    "In the centre of the sixth floor, a series of red-bound books sat on crimson velvet cloth beneath a glass display case. The way the soft lamplight gleamed against their leather covers made them look quite magical \u2013 more like magicians\u2019 grimoires than common reference materials.",
    "The Grammaticas were bound volumes of varying thicknesses but identical binding, arranged alphabetically by the Romanized name of the language and by publication date within those languages. Some Grammatica sets \u2013 notably the European languages \u2013 took up entire display cases on their own; others, largely the Oriental languages, contained very few volumes. The Chinese Grammaticas spanned only three volumes; the Japanese and Korean Grammaticas contained only one volume each. Tagalog, surprisingly, spanned five volumes.",
    "\u2018But we can\u2019t take credit for that,\u2019 said Anthony. \u2018All of that translation work was done by the Spanish; that\u2019s why you\u2019ll also see Spanish-to-English translator credits behind the cover pages. And a good deal of the Caribbean and South Asian Grammaticas \u2013 here they are \u2013 are still in progress. Those languages weren\u2019t of interest at Babel until after the Peace of Paris, which of course dumped a great deal of territory into Britain\u2019s imperial holdings.",
    "Similarly, you\u2019ll find most of the African Grammaticas are translated into English from German \u2013 it\u2019s the German missionaries and philologists who are doing the most work there; we haven\u2019t had anyone doing African languages for years.\u2019.",
    "Robin couldn\u2019t help himself. He reached eagerly for the Oriental language Grammaticas and began thumbing through the front material. Written on the cover page of each volume in very neat, tiny handwriting were the names of those scholars who had produced the first edition of each Grammatica. Nathaniel Halhed had written the Bengali Grammatica, Sir William Jones the Sanskrit Grammatica. This was a pattern, Robin noticed \u2013 the initial authors all tended to be white British men rather than native speakers of those languages.",
    "\u2018It\u2019s only recently that we\u2019ve done much in Oriental languages at all,\u2019 said Anthony. \u2018We were lagging behind the French there for quite a while. Sir William Jones made some headway introducing Sanskrit, Arabic, and Persian to the courses lists when he was a fellow here \u2013 he started the Persian Grammatica in 1771 \u2013 but he was the only one doing any serious work in those languages until 1803.\u2019",
    "Reverently, Robin reached out and pulled the first volume of the Chinese Grammatica towards him. The tome felt inordinately heavy, each page weighted down by ink. He recognized Professor Lovell\u2019s cramped, neat handwriting on each page. It covered an astonishing breadth of research. He put the volume down, struck with the unsettling realization that Professor Lovell \u2013 a foreigner \u2013 knew more about his mother tongue than he did.",
    "\u2018Because these are the only editions in Oxford,\u2019 said Anthony. \u2018There are backups at Cambridge, Edinburgh, and the Foreign Offices in London. Those are updated annually to account for new findings. But these are the only comprehensive, authoritative collections of knowledge of every language that exist. New work is added by hand, you\u2019ll notice \u2013 it costs too much to reprint every time new additions are made, and besides, our printing presses can\u2019t handle that many foreign scripts.\u2019",
    "\u2018A year? Try decades. But that\u2019ll never happen.\u2019 Anthony tapped the table, which Robin noticed was inlaid with dozens of slim silver bars. \u2018The Grammaticas are better protected than the Princess Victoria. These books are impervious to fire, flood, and attempted removal by anyone who isn\u2019t in the Institute register. If anyone tried to steal or damage one of these, they\u2019d be struck by an unseen force so powerful they\u2019d lose all sense of self and purpose until the police arrived.\u2019",
    "\u2018Well, something close,\u2019 Anthony said. \u2018I\u2019m just guessing. Professor Playfair does the protective wards, and he likes to be mysterious about them. But yes, the security of this tower would astound you. It looks like your standard Oxford building, but if anyone ever tried to break in, they\u2019d find themselves bleeding out on the street. I\u2019ve seen it happen.\u2019",
    "The eighth floor was the only part of Babel that lay hidden behind doors and walls. The other seven were designed following an open floor plan, with no barriers surrounding the staircase, but the stairs to the eighth floor led to a brick hallway which in turn led to a heavy wooden door.",
    "\u2018Fire barrier,\u2019 Anthony explained. \u2018In case of accidents. Seals off the rest of the building so that the Grammaticas don\u2019t get burnt if something up here explodes.\u2019 He leaned his weight against the door and pushed.",
    "The eighth floor looked more like a workshop than a research library. Scholars stood bent around worktables like mechanics, holding assortments of engraving tools to silver bars of all shapes and sizes. Whirring, humming, drilling sounds filled the air. Something exploded near the window, causing a shower of sparks followed by a round of cursing, but no one so much as glanced up.",
    "A portly, grey-haired white man stood waiting for them in front of the workstations. He had a broad, smile-wrinkled face and the sort of twinkling eyes that could have placed him anywhere between forty and sixty. His black master\u2019s gowns were coated with so much silver dust that he shimmered whenever he moved. His eyebrows were thick, dark, and extraordinarily expressive; they seemed ready to leap off his face with enthusiasm whenever he spoke.",
    "\u2018Good morning,\u2019 he said. \u2018I\u2019m Professor Jerome Playfair, chair of the faculty. I dabble in French and Italian, but my first love is German. Thank you, Anthony, you\u2019re free to go. Are you and Woodhouse all set for your Jamaica trip?\u2019",
    "For a moment, no one spoke. Letty, Ramy, and Victoire all seemed as stunned as Robin felt. They\u2019d been exposed to a great deal of information at once, and the effect was that Robin wasn\u2019t sure the ground he stood on was real.",
    "Professor Playfair chuckled. \u2018I know. I had the same impression on my first day here as well. It\u2019s rather like an induction into a hidden world, isn\u2019t it? Like taking food in the seelie court. Once you know what happens in the tower, the mundane world doesn\u2019t seem half as interesting.\u2019",
    "He cleared his throat. \u2018Now I\u2019d like to tell a story. Forgive me for being dramatic, but I like to mark this occasion \u2013 your first day, after all, in what I believe is the most important research centre in the world. Would that be all right?\u2019",
    "\u2018Thank you. Now, we know this following story from Herodotus.\u2019 He paced several steps before them, like a player marking out his position on the stage. \u2018He tells us of the Egyptian king Psammetichus, who once formed a pact with Ionian sea raiders to defeat the eleven kings who had betrayed him. After he had overthrown his enemies, he gave large tracts of land to his Ionian allies. But Psammetichus wanted an even better guarantee that the Ionians would not turn on him as his former allies once had. He wanted to prevent wars based on misunderstandings.",
    "\u2018Here at Babel, we take inspiration from Psammetichus.\u2019 He peered around, and his sparkling gaze landed on each of them in turn as he spoke. \u2018Translation, from time immemorial, has been the facilitator of peace. Translation makes possible communication, which in turn makes possible the kind of diplomacy, trade, and cooperation between foreign peoples that brings wealth and prosperity to all.",
    "\u2018You\u2019ve noticed by now, surely, that Babel alone among the Oxford faculties accepts students not of European origin. Nowhere else in this country will you find Hindus, Muslims, Africans, and Chinamen studying under the same roof. We accept you not despite, but because of your foreign backgrounds.\u2019 Professor Playfair emphasized this last part as if it was a matter of great pride. \u2018Because of your origins, you have the gift of languages those born in England cannot imitate. And you, like Psammetichus\u2019s boys, are the tongues that will speak this vision of global harmony into being.\u2019",
    "He clasped his hands before him as if in prayer. \u2018Anyhow. The postgrads make fun of me for that spiel every year. They think it\u2019s trite. But I think the situation calls for such gravity, don\u2019t you? After all, we\u2019re here to make the unknown known, to make the other familiar. We\u2019re here to make magic with words.\u2019",
    "This was, Robin thought, the kindest thing anyone had ever had to say about his being foreign-born. And though the story made his gut squirm \u2013 for he had read the relevant passage of Herodotus, and recalled that the Egyptian boys were nevertheless slaves \u2013 he felt also a thrum of excitement at the thought that perhaps his unbelonging did not doom him to existing forever on the margins, that perhaps, instead, it made him special.",
    "Next, Professor Playfair gathered them around an empty worktable for a demonstration. \u2018Now, the common man thinks that silver-working is equivalent to sorcery.\u2019 He rolled his sleeves up to his elbows as he spoke, shouting so they could hear him over the din. \u2018They think that the power of the bars lies in the silver itself, that silver is some inherently magical substance which contains the power to alter the world.\u2019",
    "He unlocked the left drawer and pulled out a blank silver bar. \u2018They\u2019re not wholly wrong. There is indeed something special about silver that makes it an ideal vehicle for what we do. I like to think that it was blessed by the gods \u2013 it\u2019s refined with mercury, after all, and Mercury is the messenger god, no? Mercury, Hermes. Does silver not then have an inextricable link to hermeneutics? But let\u2019s not get too romantic. No, the power of the bar lies in words.",
    "More specifically, the stuff of language that words are incapable of expressing \u2013 the stuff that gets lost when we move between one language and another. The silver catches what\u2019s lost and manifests it into being.\u2019.",
    "He glanced up, took in their baffled faces. \u2018You have questions. Don\u2019t worry. You won\u2019t start working with silver until near the end of your third year. You\u2019ll have plenty of time to catch up on the relevant theory before then. What matters now is that you understand the magnitude of what we do here.\u2019 He reached for an engraving pen. \u2018Which is, of course, the casting of spells.\u2019",
    "He finished writing on that end, then held it up to show them. \u2018Heimlich. German for the secret and clandestine, which is how I\u2019ll translate it to English. But heimlich means more than just secrets. We derive heimlich from a Proto-Germanic word that means \u201chome\u201d. Put together this constellation of meaning, and what do you get? Something like the secret, private feeling you get from being somewhere you belong, secluded from the outside world.\u2019",
    "The world shifted. Something bound them \u2013 some intangible barrier blurred the air around them, drowned out the surrounding noise, made it feel as though they were the only ones on a floor they knew was crowded with scholars. They were safe here. They were alone. This was their tower, their refuge.*",
    "They were no strangers to this magic. They had all seen silver-work in effect before; in England it was impossible to avoid. But it was one thing to know the bars could work, that silver-work was simply the foundation of a functioning, advanced society. It was another thing to witness with their own eyes the warping of reality, the way words seized what no words could describe and invoked a physical effect that should not be.",
    "And Robin, watching the still quivering bar, saw clearly now that it was all worth it. The loneliness, the beatings, the long and aching hours of study, the ingesting of languages like bitter tonic so that he could one day do this \u2013 it was all worth it.",
    "\u2018Your blood. It won\u2019t take long.\u2019 Professor Playfair led them through the lobby to a small, windowless room hidden behind the shelves, which was empty save for a plain table and four chairs. He gestured for them to sit, then strode to the back wall, where a series of drawers were concealed inside the stone. He pulled out the top drawer, revealing stacks and stacks of tiny glass vials within. Each one was labelled with the name of the scholar whose blood it contained.",
    "\u2018It\u2019s for the wards,\u2019 Professor Playfair explained. \u2018Babel sees more robbery attempts than all of the banks in London combined. The doors keep most of the riffraff out, but the wards need some way to distinguish scholars from intruders. We\u2019ve tried hair and fingernails, but they\u2019re too easy to steal.\u2019",
    "Robin volunteered; he didn\u2019t want to suffer the anticipation of watching the others. Ramy went next, and then Victoire, and then Letty. The whole procedure took less than fifteen minutes, with none the worse for the wear, though Letty had turned disturbingly green by the time the needle left her arm.",
    "\u2018Not at all,\u2019 said Professor Playfair. \u2018You\u2019re in the place where magic is made. It\u2019s got all the trappings of a modern university, but at its heart, Babel isn\u2019t so different from the alchemists\u2019 lairs of old. But unlike the alchemists, we\u2019ve actually figured out the key to the transformation of a thing. It\u2019s not in the material substance. It\u2019s in the name.\u2019",
    "Babel shared a buttery in the Radcliffe quadrangle with several other humanities faculties. The food there was supposedly very good, but it was closed until start of classes tomorrow, so instead they headed back to the college just in time for the tail end of lunch service. All the hot food was gone, but afternoon tea and its trappings were on offer until supper. They loaded trays with teacups, teapots, sugar bowls, milk jugs, and scones, then navigated the long wooden tables in hall until they found an unoccupied one in the corner.",
    "\u2018And you know,\u2019 now Ramy was buttering his scone with great vim, \u2018it\u2019s very irritating, actually, the way everyone wants to equate India with Hinduism. \u201cOh, Muslim rule is an aberration, an intrusion; the Mughals just interlopers, but tradition \u2013 that\u2019s Sanskrit, that\u2019s the Upanishads.\u201d\u2019 He lifted his scone to his mouth. \u2018But you don\u2019t even know what any of those words mean, do you?\u2019",
    "They sipped their tea in silence. Victoire clinked her spoon nervously around her cup. Robin stared out of the window. Ramy tapped his fingers against the table but stopped when Letty shot him a glare.",
    "\u2018How have you found the place?\u2019 Victoire tried valiantly to rescue their conversation. \u2018Oxfordshire, I mean. I feel like we\u2019ve only seen a fraction of it so far, it\u2019s so big. I mean, not like London or Paris, but there are so many hidden corners, don\u2019t you think?\u2019",
    "\u2018It\u2019s incredible,\u2019 Robin said with a bit too much enthusiasm. \u2018It\u2019s unreal, every single building \u2013 we spent the first three days just walking around, staring. We saw all the tourist attractions \u2013 the Oxford Museum, the Christ Church gardens\u2014\u2019",
    "\u2018We came back when a different docent was on shift and pretended this time to be men.\u2019 Victoire deepened her voice. \u2018Excuse me, we\u2019re just countryside lads visiting our cousins here and we\u2019ve nothing to do when they\u2019re in class\u2014\u2019",
    "\u2018No, really.\u2019 Victoire smiled. She had, Robin noticed, enormous and very pretty doe-like eyes. He liked listening to her speak; every sentence felt like she was pulling laughter out from inside him. \u2018They must have thought we were about twelve, but it worked like a dream\u2014\u2019",
    "\u2018Oh, yes.\u2019 He threw his arm around Robin\u2019s shoulders. \u2018I was ready to break some noses, but this one did the prudent thing \u2013 started running like the hounds of hell were behind him \u2013 so then I couldn\u2019t do anything but run as well.\u2019",
    "Soon it became apparent that no topics were off limits. They could talk about anything, share all the indescribable humiliations they felt being in a place they were not supposed to be, all the lurking unease that until now they\u2019d kept to themselves. They offered up everything about themselves because they had, at last, found the only group of people for whom their experiences were not so unique or baffling.",
    "Next they traded stories about their educations before Oxford. Babel, apparently, always anointed its chosen ones at a young age. Letty, who was from down south in Brighton, had dazzled family friends with her prodigious memory ever since she could speak; one such friend, who knew some Oxford dons, secured her a set of tutors and had her drilled in French, German, Latin, and Greek until she was old enough to matriculate.",
    "\u2018Though I almost didn\u2019t make it.\u2019 Letty blinked, eyelashes fluttering madly. \u2018Father said he\u2019d never pay for a woman\u2019s education, so I\u2019m grateful for the scholarship. I had to sell a set of bracelets to pay for the coach fare up.\u2019",
    "Victoire, like Robin and Ramy, had come to Europe with a guardian. \u2018Paris,\u2019 she clarified. \u2018He was a Frenchman, but he had acquaintances at the Institute, and he was going to write to them when I was old enough. Only then he died, and for a while I wasn\u2019t sure I\u2019d get to come.\u2019 Her voice faltered a bit. She took a sip of tea. \u2018But I managed to get in touch with them, and they arranged to bring me over,\u2019 she concluded vaguely.",
    "One thing united them all \u2013 without Babel, they had nowhere in this country to go. They\u2019d been chosen for privileges they couldn\u2019t have ever imagined, funded by powerful and wealthy men whose motives they did not fully understand, and they were acutely aware these could be lost at any moment. That precariousness made them simultaneously bold and terrified. They had the keys to the kingdom; they did not want to give them back.",
    "The days had not yet come when Ramy wore Victoire\u2019s sloppily knitted scarves with pride, when Robin learned exactly how long Ramy liked his tea steeped so he could have it ready when he inevitably came to the Buttery late from his Arabic tutorial, or when they all knew Letty was about to come to class with a paper bag full of lemon biscuits because it was a Wednesday morning and Taylor\u2019s bakery put out lemon biscuits on Wednesdays. But that afternoon they could see with certainty the kind of friends they would be, and loving that vision was close enough..",
    "Later, when everything went sideways and the world broke in half, Robin would think back to this day, to this hour at this table, and wonder why they had been so quick, so carelessly eager to trust one another. Why had they refused to see the myriad ways they could hurt each other? Why had they not paused to interrogate their differences in birth, in raising, that meant they were not and could never be on the same side?",
    "The girls were not allowed to live in college, which was why they hadn\u2019t crossed paths with Robin and Ramy until the first day of instruction. Instead, Victoire and Letty lodged about two miles away in the servant annex of one of the Oxford day schools, which was apparently a common arrangement for Babel\u2019s female students. Robin and Ramy accompanied them home because it seemed the gentlemanly thing to do, but Robin hoped this would not become a nightly routine, as the road really was quite far away and there was no omnibus at this hour.",
    "\u2018It\u2019s up ahead on Harrow Lane near the bridge,\u2019 said Victoire. \u2018You won\u2019t like it, though. We took a peek and walked right back out \u2013 it\u2019s awfully dirty inside. Run your finger around the glass and you\u2019ll find a wadge of grease and dirt a quarter of an inch thick.\u2019",
    "They parted on Woodstock Road. Ramy went down south straight back to the college. Robin cut right in search of the bridge Victoire had pointed out, unsure of what he was looking for except for the memory of a whispered phrase.",
    "\u2018You\u2019re Robin Swift,\u2019 said the man. \u2018You grew up without a father but with an inexplicable English nursemaid and a never-ending supply of books in English, and when Professor Lovell turned up to carry you off to England, you said farewell to your motherland for good. You think the professor might be your father, but he hasn\u2019t admitted that you are his own. You\u2019re quite sure he never will. Does that make sense?\u2019",
    "They found a table in the back corner of the Twisted Root. Robin\u2019s doppelg\u00e4nger ordered them two glasses of a light golden ale. Robin drained half his glass in three desperate gulps and felt somewhat steadier, though no less confused.",
    "Upon closer inspection, he and Robin were not so alike after all. He was several years older, and his face bore a hard maturity that Robin\u2019s hadn\u2019t yet acquired. His voice was deeper, less forgiving, more assertive. He was several inches taller than Robin, though he was also much thinner; indeed, he appeared composed entirely of sharp edges and angles. His hair was darker, his skin paler. He looked like a print illustration of Robin, the lighting contrasts amplified and the colour blanched out.",
    "\u2018It\u2019s true. A girl and a boy, seven and three. Darling Philippa and little Dick. The wife\u2019s name is Johanna. He\u2019s got them squirrelled away in a lovely estate in Yorkshire. It\u2019s partly how he gets funding for voyages abroad \u2013 he came from nothing, but she\u2019s terribly rich. Five hundred pounds a year, I\u2019m told.\u2019",
    "\u2018Does she know about us? Absolutely not. Though I don\u2019t think she\u2019d care if she did, apart from the obvious reputational problems. There\u2019s no love lost in that marriage. He wanted an estate and she wanted bragging rights. They see each other about twice a year, and the rest of his time he lives here, or in Hampstead. We\u2019re the children he spends the most time with, funnily enough.\u2019 Griffin cocked his head. \u2018At least, you are.\u2019",
    "\u2018Gulliver\u2019s Travels,\u2019 Robin admitted. It sounded very silly when he said it out loud. Everything about Griffin made him feel like a child in contrast. \u2018It \u2013 it\u2019s one of my favourite books. Professor Lovell said to pick whatever I liked, and that was the first name that came to mind.\u2019",
    "Griffin\u2019s lip curled. \u2018He\u2019s softened a bit, then. Me, he took to a street corner before we signed the papers and told me foundlings were often named after the places they\u2019d been abandoned. Said I could walk the city until I found a word that didn\u2019t sound too ridiculous.\u2019",
    "\u2018Sure. Harley. Nowhere special in particular, I just saw it above a shop and I liked the way it sounded. The shapes your mouth has to make, the release of the second syllable. But I\u2019m no Harley, I\u2019m a Lovell, just as you\u2019re no Swift.\u2019",
    "\u2018Fair enough.\u2019 Griffin leaned forward. At dinnertime the Twisted Root was just crowded enough that the hubbub cast a shroud of noise over any individual conversation, but still Griffin lowered his voice to such a quiet murmur that Robin had to strain to hear. \u2018Here\u2019s the long and short of it. I\u2019m a criminal. My colleagues and I regularly steal silver, manuscripts, and engraving materials from Babel and funnel them across England to our associates throughout the world.",
    "What you did last night was treason, and if anyone found out, you\u2019d be locked up in Newgate for twenty years at least, but only after they\u2019d tortured you in an attempt to get to us.\u2019 All this he uttered very quickly, with hardly any change in tone or volume. When finished, he leaned back, looking satisfied..",
    "Griffin didn\u2019t respond at once. He looked Robin up and down for several seconds, examining his face as if searching for something \u2013 some further resemblance, some crucial, innate quality. Then he asked, \u2018Why did your mother die?\u2019",
    "I don\u2019t know why, Robin wanted to say, but he did. He\u2019d always known, he\u2019d just forced himself not to dwell on it. In all this time, he had never let himself ask this particular formulation of the question.",
    "Robin lurched forward, tripping on the cobblestones. He righted himself and hurried after Griffin. He\u2019d never had ale before, only weak wines at Mrs Piper\u2019s table, and the hops left his tongue feeling numb. He had a strong urge to vomit. Why had he drunk so much? He felt dazed, twice as slow at putting together his thoughts \u2013 but of course that was the point. It was clear Griffin had wanted him off-kilter, unguarded. Robin suspected Griffin liked to keep people unbalanced.",
    "\u2018South. Then west. Doesn\u2019t matter; it\u2019s just that the best way to avoid being overheard is to always be on the move.\u2019 Griffin pivoted down Canterbury Road. \u2018If you\u2019re standing still, then your tail can hide and catch the whole conversation, but it makes things harder for them when you\u2019re weaving about.\u2019",
    "Robin ducked inside the shop and hastily purchased a selection of the plainest pastries he could find \u2013 he didn\u2019t want Ramy to grow suspicious the next time they passed Taylor\u2019s glass display. He had a burlap sack in his room; he could discard the shop boxes when he got home and dump the cakes in there.",
    "\u2018Just what I told you. We redistribute it. We\u2019re Robin Hood. Ha, ha. Robin. No? All right. We send bars and silver-working materials all over the world to people who need them \u2013 people who don\u2019t have the luxury of being rich and British. People like your mother. See, Babel\u2019s a dazzling place, but it\u2019s only dazzling because it sells its match-pairs to a very limited customer base.\u2019 Griffin glanced over his shoulder. There was no one around them save a washerwoman lugging a basket down the other end of the street, but he quickened his pace regardless. \u2018So are you in?\u2019",
    "\u2018Certainly Babel does. We\u2019ve had a \u2013 well, it\u2019s been quite back and forth, shall we say? But they don\u2019t know much, and certainly not as much as they\u2019d like to. We\u2019re very good at staying in the shadows.\u2019",
    "\u2018You see why this makes things very difficult for me, though?\u2019 Robin thought Griffin was brushing off some rather reasonable concerns. \u2018I don\u2019t know a thing about you either. You could be lying, you could be trying to frame me\u2014\u2019",
    "Robin took in Griffin\u2019s lean, underfed frame, his frayed black coat, and his unkempt hair. No \u2013 he had to admit, the Hermes Society did not seem like a scheme for personal profit. Perhaps Griffin was using the stolen silver for some other secret means, but personal gain did not seem like one of them.",
    "\u2018I want to. I mean \u2013 I\u2019m just \u2013 this is so much.\u2019 Robin shook his head. \u2018I\u2019ve only just arrived here, I\u2019ve only just seen Babel for the first time, and I don\u2019t know you or this place well enough to have the slightest idea what\u2019s going on\u2014\u2019",
    "He\u2019d asked himself this a thousand times. Why had he activated that bar? It wasn\u2019t merely because the whole situation \u2013 the midnight hour, the moonlight glow \u2013 had been so dreamlike that rules and consequences seemed to disappear, or because the sight of his doppelg\u00e4nger had made him doubt reality itself. He\u2019d felt some deeper compulsion he couldn\u2019t explain. \u2018It just seemed right.\u2019",
    "They\u2019d looped back round to Banbury Road. The University Parks loomed lush before them, and Robin half hoped they would cut south to Parks Road \u2013 it was getting late, and the night was quite cold \u2013 but Griffin took them north, further from the city centre.",
    "\u2018Ha. Adorable. No, they\u2019re used for sitting room decorations. That\u2019s right \u2013 alarm clocks that sound like real roosters, lights that dim and brighten on vocal demand, curtains that change colour throughout the day, that sort of thing. Because they\u2019re fun, and because the British upper class can afford them, and whatever rich Britons want, they get.\u2019",
    "\u2018No, that\u2019s just how the world works. Let me paint you a picture, brother. You\u2019ve noticed by now that London sits at the centre of a vast empire that won\u2019t stop growing. The single most important enabler of this growth is Babel. Babel collects foreign languages and foreign talent the same way it hoards silver and uses them to produce translation magic that benefits England and England only. The vast majority of all silver bars in use in the world are in London.",
    "The newest, most powerful bars in use rely on Chinese, Sanskrit, and Arabic to work, but you\u2019ll count less than a thousand bars in the countries where those languages are widely spoken, and then only in the homes of the wealthy and powerful. And that\u2019s wrong. That\u2019s predatory. That\u2019s fundamentally unjust.\u2019.",
    "Griffin had a habit of crisply punctuating each sentence with an open hand, like a conductor bearing down again and again over the same note. \u2018But how does this happen?\u2019 he continued. \u2018How does all the power from foreign languages just somehow accrue to England? This is no accident; this is a deliberate exploitation of foreign culture and foreign resources. The professors like to pretend that the tower is a refuge for pure knowledge, that it sits above the mundane concerns of business and commerce, but it does not. It\u2019s intricately tied to the business of colonialism.",
    "It is the business of colonialism. Ask yourself why the Literature Department only translates works into English and not the other way around, or what the interpreters are being sent abroad to do. Everything Babel does is in the service of expanding the Empire. Consider \u2013 Sir Horace Wilson, who\u2019s the first endowed chair in Sanskrit in Oxford history, spends half his time conducting tutorials for Christian missionaries..",
    "\u2018The point of it all is to keep amassing silver. We possess all this silver because we cajole, manipulate, and threaten other countries into trade deals that keep the cash flowing homeward. And we enforce those trade deals with the very same silver bars, now inscribed with Babel\u2019s work, that make our ships faster, our soldiers hardier, and our guns more deadly. It\u2019s a vicious circle of profit, and unless some outside force breaks the cycle, sooner or later Britain will possess all the wealth in the world.",
    "\u2018We are that outside force. Hermes. We funnel silver away to people, communities, and movements that deserve it. We aid slave revolts. Resistance movements. We melt down silver bars made for cleaning doilies and use them to cure disease instead.\u2019 Griffin slowed down; turned to look Robin in the eyes. \u2018That\u2019s what this is all for.\u2019",
    "Why indeed? Robin tried to sort through his confusion, to find a reason for prudence that did not simply boil down to fear. But that was precisely it \u2013 fear of consequences, fear of breaking the gorgeous illusion of the Oxford he\u2019d won admission to, the one Griffin had just sullied before he\u2019d been able to properly enjoy it.",
    "\u2018That\u2019s the thing about secret societies,\u2019 said Griffin. \u2018They\u2019re easy to romanticize. You think it\u2019s this long courting process \u2013 that you\u2019ll be inducted, shown a whole new world, shown all the levers and people at play. If you\u2019ve formed your only impression of secret societies from novels and penny dreadfuls, then you might expect rituals and passwords and secret meetings in abandoned warehouses.",
    "\u2018But that\u2019s not how things work, brother. This is not a penny dreadful. Real life is messy, scary, and uncertain.\u2019 Griffin\u2019s tone softened. \u2018You should understand, what I\u2019m asking you to do is very dangerous. People die over these bars \u2013 I\u2019ve watched friends die over these bars. Babel would like to crush the life out of us, and you don\u2019t want to know what happens to the Hermes members they catch. We exist because we\u2019re decentralized. We don\u2019t put all of our information in one place. So I can\u2019t ask you to take your time reviewing all the information.",
    "For the first time, Robin registered that Griffin was not as confident, not as intimidating as his rapid-fire speech made him sound. He stood, hands wedged in his pockets, shoulders hunched and shivering against the biting autumn wind. And he was so visibly nervous. He was twitching, fidgeting; his eyes darted over his shoulder every time he finished a sentence. Robin was confused, distressed, but Griffin was scared.",
    "\u2018It\u2019s got to be like this,\u2019 Griffin insisted. \u2018Minimal information. Quick judgment calls. I\u2019d love to show you my whole world \u2013 I promise, it\u2019s not fun being alone \u2013 but the fact remains you\u2019re a Babel student who I\u2019ve known for less than a day. The time may come when I trust you with everything, but that\u2019ll only be when you\u2019ve proven yourself, and when I\u2019ve got no other options. For now, I\u2019ve told you what we do, and what we need from you. Will you join us?\u2019",
    "This audience, Robin realized, was drawing to an end. He was being asked to make a final decision \u2013 and if he said no, he suspected, then Griffin would simply vanish from the Oxford he knew, would fade so effectively into the shadows that Robin would be left wondering if he\u2019d imagined the entire encounter. \u2018I want to \u2013 I do, really, but I still don\u2019t \u2013 I just need time to think. Please.\u2019",
    "He knew this would frustrate Griffin. But Robin was terrified. He felt he\u2019d been led to the edge of a precipice and told, with no assurances, to jump. He felt as he had seven years ago, when Professor Lovell had slid a contract before him and calmly asked that he sign away his future. Only then he\u2019d had nothing, so there had been nothing to lose. This time he had everything \u2013 food, clothing, shelter \u2013 and no guarantee of survival at the other end.",
    "\u2018Five days, then,\u2019 said Griffin. He looked cross, but he made no recriminations. \u2018You get five days. There\u2019s a lone birch in the Merton College gardens \u2013 you\u2019ll know it when you see it. Scratch a cross in the trunk by Saturday if it\u2019s a yes. Don\u2019t bother if it\u2019s a no.\u2019",
    "\u2018We\u2019re in Summertown,\u2019 said Griffin. \u2018Pretty, though a bit boring. Woodstock\u2019s at the end of this green \u2013 just take a left and walk all the way down south until things start looking familiar. We\u2019ll part here. Five days.\u2019 Griffin turned to go.",
    "\u2018Wait \u2013 how do I reach you?\u2019 Robin asked. Now that Griffin\u2019s departure seemed imminent, he was somehow reluctant to part ways. He had a sudden fear that if he let Griffin out of his sight then he might disappear for good, that this would all turn out to be a dream.",
    "\u2018I left Babel after my third year,\u2019 Griffin said quietly. \u2018I\u2019d been with Hermes since I started, but I was on the inside like you. Then something happened, and it wasn\u2019t safe anymore, so I ran. And since then I\u2019ve . . .\u2019 He trailed off, then cleared his throat. \u2018But that\u2019s beside the point. All you need to know is you probably shouldn\u2019t mention my name at dinner.\u2019",
    "Professor Playfair\u2019s introductory class to Translation Theory met at Tuesday mornings on the fifth floor of the tower. They\u2019d barely been seated when he began to lecture, filling the narrow classroom with his booming showman\u2019s voice.",
    "\u2018By now you are each passably fluent in at least three languages, which is a feat in its own right. Today, however, I will try to impress upon you the unique difficulty of translation. Consider how tricky it is merely to say the word hello. Hello seems so easy! Bonjour. Ciao. Hallo. And on and on. But then say we are translating from Italian into English. In Italian, ciao can be used upon greeting or upon parting \u2013 it does not specify either, it simply marks etiquette at the point of contact. It is derived from the Venetian s-ci\u00e0o vostro, meaning something akin to \u201cyour obedient servant\u201d.",
    "But I digress. The point is, when we bring ciao into English \u2013 if we are translating a scene where the characters disperse, for example \u2013 we must impose that ciao has been said as goodbye. Sometimes this is obvious from context, but sometimes not \u2013 sometimes we must add new words in our translation. So already things are complicated, and we haven\u2019t moved past hello..",
    "\u2018The first lesson any good translator internalizes is that there exists no one-to-one correlation between words or even concepts from one language to another. The Swiss philologist Johann Breitinger, who claimed that languages were merely \u201ccollections of totally equivalent words and locutions which are interchangeable, and which fully correspond to each other in meaning\u201d, was dreadfully wrong. Language is not like maths. And even maths differs depending on the language* \u2013 but we will revisit that later.\u2019",
    "Robin found himself searching Professor Playfair\u2019s face as he spoke. He was not sure what he was looking for. Some evidence of evil, perhaps. The cruel, selfish, lurking monster Griffin had sketched. But Professor Playfair seemed only a cheerful, beaming scholar, enamoured by the beauty of words. Indeed, in daylight, in the classroom, his brother\u2019s grand conspiracies felt quite ridiculous.",
    "\u2018Language does not exist as a nomenclature for a set of universal concepts,\u2019 Professor Playfair went on. \u2018If it did, then translation would not be a highly skilled profession \u2013 we would simply sit a class full of dewy-eyed freshers down with dictionaries and have the completed works of the Buddha on our shelves in no time. Instead, we have to learn to dance between that age-old dichotomy, helpfully elucidated by Cicero and Hieronymus: verbum e verbo and sensum e sensu. Can anyone\u2014\u2019",
    "\u2018It would,\u2019 said Professor Playfair, \u2018if, again, words existed in relation to each other in the same way in every language. But they do not. The words schlecht and schlimm both mean \u201cbad\u201d in German, but how do you know when to use one or the other? When do we use fleuve or rivi\u00e8re in French? How do we render the French esprit into English? We ought not merely translate each word on its own, but must rather evoke the sense of how they fit the whole of the passage.",
    "But how can that be done, if languages are indeed so different? These differences aren\u2019t trivial, mind you \u2013 Erasmus wrote an entire treatise on why he rendered the Greek logos into the Latin sermo in his translation of the New Testament. Translating word-for-word is simply inadequate.\u2019.",
    "\u2018Those are the laboured births of slavish brains, not the effect of poetry, but pains,\u2019 Professor Playfair finished. \u2018John Denham. Very nice, Mr Mirza. So you see, translators do not so much deliver a message as they rewrite the original. And herein lies the difficulty \u2013 rewriting is still writing, and writing always reflects the author\u2019s ideology and biases. After all, the Latin translatio means \u201cto carry across\u201d. Translation involves a spatial dimension \u2013 a literal transportation of texts across conquered territory, words delivered like spices from an alien land.",
    "\u2018And we have not yet moved past the lexical. If translation were only a matter of finding the right themes, the right general ideas, then theoretically we could eventually make our meaning clear, couldn\u2019t we? But something gets in the way \u2013 syntax, grammar, morphology and orthography, all the things that form the bones of a language. Consider the Heinrich Heine poem \u201cEin Fichtenbaum\u201d. It\u2019s short, and its message is quite easy to grasp. A pine tree, longing for a palm tree, represents a man\u2019s desire for a woman.",
    "Yet translating it into English has been devilishly tricky, because English doesn\u2019t have genders like German does. So there\u2019s no way to convey the binary opposition between the masculine ein Fichtenbaum and the feminine einer Palme. You see? So we must proceed from the starting assumption that distortion is inevitable. The question is how to distort with deliberation.\u2019.",
    "\u2018First, that the translation conveys a complete and accurate idea of the original,\u2019 said Victoire. \u2018Second, that the translation mirrors the style and manner of writing of the original. And third, that the translation should read with all the ease of the original composition.\u2019",
    "She spoke with such confident precision, Robin thought she must have been reading from the text. He was very impressed when he glanced over and saw her consulting nothing but blank space. Ramy, too, had this talent for perfect recall \u2013 Robin was beginning to feel a bit intimidated by his cohort.",
    "\u2018Very good,\u2019 said Professor Playfair. \u2018This sounds basic enough. But what do we mean by the \u201cstyle and manner\u201d of the original? What does it mean for a composition to read \u201ceasily\u201d? What audience do we have in mind when we make these claims? These are the questions we will tackle this term, and such fascinating questions they are.\u2019 He clasped his hands together. \u2018Allow me again to descend into theatrics by discussing our namesake, Babel \u2013 yes, dear students, I can\u2019t quite escape the romanticism of this institution. Indulge me, please.\u2019",
    "His tone conveyed no regret at all. Professor Playfair loved this dramatic mysticism, these monologues that must have been rehearsed and perfected over years of teaching. But no one complained. They loved it too.",
    "\u2018It is often argued that the greatest tragedy of the Old Testament was not man\u2019s exile from the Garden of Eden, but the fall of the Tower of Babel. For Adam and Eve, though cast from grace, could still speak and comprehend the language of angels. But when men in their hubris decided to build a path to heaven, God confounded their understanding. He divided and confused them and scattered them about the face of the earth.",
    "\u2018What was lost at Babel was not merely human unity, but the original language \u2013 something primordial and innate, perfectly understandable and lacking nothing in form or content. Biblical scholars call it the Adamic language. Some think it is Hebrew. Some think it is a real but ancient language that has been lost to time. Some think it is a new, artificial language that we ought to invent. Some think French fulfils this role; some think English, once it\u2019s finished robbing and morphing, might.\u2019",
    "\u2018Very funny, Mr Mirza.\u2019 Robin did not know if Ramy was indeed joking, but no one else made a comment. Professor Playfair ploughed ahead. \u2018For me, however, it matters not what the Adamic language was, for it\u2019s clear we have lost any access to it. We will never speak the divine language. But by amassing all the world\u2019s languages under this roof, by collecting the full range of human expressions, or as near to it as we can get, we can try. We will never touch heaven from this mortal plane, but our confusion is not infinite.",
    "We can, through perfecting the arts of translation, achieve what humanity lost at Babel.\u2019 Professor Playfair sighed, moved by his own performance. Robin thought he saw actual tears form in the corners of his eyes..",
    "\u2018Magic.\u2019 Professor Playfair pressed a hand against his chest. \u2018What we are doing is magic. It won\u2019t always feel that way \u2013 indeed, when you do tonight\u2019s exercise, it\u2019ll feel more like folding laundry than chasing the ephemeral. But never forget the audacity of what you are attempting. Never forget that you are defying a curse laid by God.\u2019",
    "\u2018I only . . .\u2019 Robin faltered. It sounded silly as he said it, a child\u2019s fancy, not a serious scholarly query. Letty and Victoire were frowning at him; even Ramy was wrinkling his nose. Robin tried again \u2013 he knew what he meant to ask, only he couldn\u2019t think of an elegant or subtle way to phrase it. \u2018Well \u2013 since in the Bible, God split mankind apart. And I wonder if \u2013 if the purpose of translation, then, is to bring mankind back together. If we translate to \u2013 I don\u2019t know, bring about that paradise again, on earth, between nations.\u2019",
    "Professor Playfair looked baffled by this. But quickly his features reassembled into a sprightly beam. \u2018Well, of course. Such is the project of empire \u2013 and why, therefore, we translate at the pleasure of the Crown.\u2019",
    "They were required to take Latin together three times a week, regardless of regional speciality. (Greek, at this stage, could be dropped for anyone not specializing in Classics.) Latin was taught by a woman named Professor Margaret Craft, who could not have been more different from Professor Playfair. She rarely smiled. She delivered her lectures without feeling and by rote memory, never glancing once at her notes, although she flipped through these as she spoke, as if she\u2019d long ago memorized her place on the page.",
    "She did not ask their names \u2013 she only ever referred to them with a pointed finger and a cold, abrupt \u2018You.\u2019 She came off at first as utterly humourless, but when Ramy read aloud one of Ovid\u2019s dryer injections \u2013 fugiebat enim, \u2018for she was fleeing\u2019, after Jove begs Io not to flee \u2013 she burst out in a fit of girlish laughter that made her seem twenty years younger; indeed, like a schoolgirl who might have sat among them. Then the moment passed, and her mask resumed its place..",
    "Robin did not like her. Her lecturing voice had an awkward, unnatural rhythm with unexpected pauses that made it hard to follow her line of argument, and the two hours they spent in her classroom seemed to drag for an eternity. Letty, however, seemed rapt. She gazed at Professor Craft with shining admiration. When they filed out at the end of class, Robin hung by the door to wait as she collected her things so they could all walk to the Buttery together. But she instead went up to Professor Craft\u2019s desk.",
    "Robin hastened around the corner and down the winding steps before Letty could see him. When she sat down with her plate in the Buttery, he saw her eyes were a bit pink around the edges. But he pretended not to notice, and if Ramy or Victoire did, they said nothing.",
    "On Wednesday afternoon, Robin had his solo tutorial in Chinese. He\u2019d half expected to find Professor Lovell in the classroom, but his instructor turned out to be Professor Anand Chakravarti, a genial and understated man who spoke English with such a pitch-perfect Londoner\u2019s accent that he might have been raised in Kensington.",
    "Chinese class was a wholly different exercise from Latin. Professor Chakravarti didn\u2019t lecture at Robin or make him do recitations. He conducted this tutorial as a conversation. He asked questions, Robin tried his best to answer, and they both tried to make sense out of what he\u2019d said.",
    "Professor Chakravarti began with questions so basic that Robin at first couldn\u2019t see how they were worth answering, until he picked apart their implications and realized they were far beyond his scope of understanding. What was a word? What was the smallest possible unit of meaning, and why was that different from a word? Was a word different from a character? In what ways was Chinese speech different from Chinese writing?",
    "It was an odd exercise to analyse and dismantle a language he thought he knew like the back of his hand, to learn to classify words by ideogram or pictogram, and to memorize an entire vocabulary of new terms, most having to do with morphology or orthography. It was like tunnelling into the crevasses of his own mind, peeling things apart to see how they worked, and it both intrigued and unsettled him.",
    "Then came the harder questions. Which Chinese words could be traced back to recognizable pictures? Which couldn\u2019t? Why was the character for \u2018woman\u2019 \u2013 \u5973 \u2013 also the radical used in the character for \u2018slavery\u2019? In the character for \u2018good\u2019?",
    "Professor Chakravarti shrugged. \u2018I don\u2019t know either. These are questions Richard and I are still trying to answer. We\u2019re far from a satisfactory edition of the Chinese Grammatica, you see. When I was studying Chinese, I had no good Chinese-English resources \u2013 I had to make do with Abel-R\u00e9musat\u2019s El\u00e9mens de la grammaire chinoise and Fourmont\u2019s Grammatica Sinica. Can you imagine? I still associate both Chinese and French with a headache. But I think we\u2019ve made progress today, actually.\u2019",
    "Then Robin realized what his place here was. He was not simply a student but a colleague, a rare native speaker capable of expanding the bounds of Babel\u2019s scant existing knowledge. Or a silver mine to be plundered, said Griffin\u2019s voice, though he pushed the thought away.",
    "The truth was, it felt exciting to contribute to the Grammaticas. But he still had much to learn. The second half of their tutorial was spent on readings in Classical Chinese, which Robin had dabbled in at Professor Lovell\u2019s home but had never tackled in a systematic manner. Classical Chinese was to vernacular Mandarin what Latin was to English; one could guess at the gist of a phrase, but the rules of grammar were unintuitive and impossible to grasp without rigorous reading practice. Punctuation was a guessing game. Nouns could be verbs when they felt like it.",
    "Often, characters had different and contradictory meanings, either of which produced valid possible interpretations \u2013 the character \u7be4, for instance, could mean both \u2018to restrict\u2019 and \u2018large, substantial\u2019..",
    "That afternoon they tackled the Shijing \u2013 the Book of Songs \u2013 which was written in a discursive context so far removed from contemporary China that even readers of the Han period would have considered it written in a foreign language.",
    "\u2018I propose we break here,\u2019 Professor Chakravarti said after twenty minutes of debating the character \u4e0d, which in most contexts meant a negative \u2018no, not\u2019, but in the given context seemed instead like a word of praise, which didn\u2019t track with anything they knew about the word. \u2018I suspect we\u2019ll have to leave this as an open question.\u2019",
    "\u2018We could,\u2019 said Professor Chakravarti. \u2018But it makes things a bit hard when the Qing Emperor has decreed it punishable by death to teach a foreigner Chinese, you see.\u2019 He patted Robin\u2019s shoulder. \u2018We make do with what we have. You\u2019re the next best thing.\u2019",
    "A strange look came over Professor Chakravarti\u2019s face then. Robin was not supposed to know about Griffin, he realized. Probably Professor Lovell had sworn the rest of the faculty to secrecy; probably, according to the official record, Griffin did not exist.",
    "\u2018Well \u2013 it\u2019s a sad story, really. He passed away. Just before his fourth year.\u2019 Professor Chakravarti scratched his temple. \u2018He fell ill on an overseas research trip and didn\u2019t make it home. It happens all the time.\u2019",
    "Professor Chakravarti\u2019s fingers quickened against the wood. \u2018Well, yes. But first there\u2019s the matter of national loyalties. It\u2019s no good recruiting scholars who might run home to the Qing government at any moment, you know. Second, Richard is of the opinion that . . . well. One requires a certain upbringing.\u2019",
    "\u2018Like yours. Otherwise, Richard thinks . . .\u2019 Professor Chakravarti was using this construction quite a lot, Robin noticed, \u2018that the Chinese tend towards certain natural inclinations. Which is to say, he doesn\u2019t think Chinese students would acclimatize well here.\u2019",
    "Professor Lovell\u2019s Oxford residence was only a shade more humble than his Hampstead estate. It was a bit smaller, and enjoyed a mere front and back garden instead of an expansive green, but it was still more than someone on a professor\u2019s salary should have been able to afford. Trees bearing plump red cherries lined the hedges by the front door, though cherries could hardly still be in season at the turn of autumn. Robin suspected that if he bent down to check the grass by their roots, he would find silver bars in the soil.",
    "\u2018Challenging, just as you warned.\u2019 Robin felt older as he spoke, his voice somehow deeper. He\u2019d left home only a week ago, but he felt like he\u2019d aged years, and could present himself now as a young man and not a boy. \u2018But challenging in a way that\u2019s enjoyable. I\u2019m learning quite a lot.\u2019",
    "They might as well have been back in Hampstead. The long table was arranged precisely the same way Robin was used to, with him and Professor Lovell sitting at opposite ends and a painting to Robin\u2019s right, which this time depicted the Thames rather than Oxford\u2019s Broad Street. Mrs Piper poured their wine and, with a wink at Robin, disappeared back into the kitchen.",
    "\u2018Right. It\u2019s fairly good going.\u2019 Robin took a sip of wine. \u2018Though Professor Craft lectures like she wouldn\u2019t notice if she were speaking to an empty room, and Professor Playfair seems to have missed a calling for the stage.\u2019",
    "\u2018Who knows, except that Herodotus tells us so,\u2019 said Professor Lovell. \u2018There\u2019s another good Herodotus story, again about Psammetichus. Psammetichus wanted to determine which language was the foundation of all earthly languages, so he gave two newborn infants to a shepherd with the instructions that they should not be allowed to hear human speech. For a while all they did was babble, as infants do. Then one day one of the infants stretched out his little hands to the shepherd and exclaimed bekos, which is the Phrygian word for bread.",
    "\u2018Not that I\u2019m aware of,\u2019 said Professor Lovell. \u2018The issue is it\u2019s impossible to isolate infants from an environment with language if you want them to develop as infants should. Might be interesting to buy a child and see \u2013 but, well, no.\u2019 Professor Lovell tilted his head. \u2018It\u2019s fun to entertain the possibility of an original language, though.\u2019",
    "He felt more confident talking to the professor now that he\u2019d spent some time at Babel. They were on more of an equal footing; they could communicate as colleagues. Dinner felt less like an interrogation and more like a casual conversation between two scholars in the same fascinating field.",
    "\u2018The Adamic language.\u2019 Professor Lovell made a face. \u2018I don\u2019t know why he fills your minds with that stuff. It\u2019s a pretty metaphor, certainly, but every few years we get an undergraduate who\u2019s determined to discover the Adamic language in Proto-Indo-European, or otherwise wholly invent it on his own, and it always takes either a stern talking-to or a few weeks of failure for him to come back to his senses.\u2019",
    "\u2018Of course I don\u2019t. The most devout Christians think it does, but you\u2019d think if the Holy Word were so innate and unambiguous, there\u2019d be less debate about its contents.\u2019 He shook his head. \u2018There are those who think that the Adamic language might be English \u2013 might become English \u2013 purely because the English language has enough military might and power behind it to credibly crowd out competitors, but then we must also remember that it was barely a century ago that Voltaire declared that French was the universal language. That was, of course, before Waterloo.",
    "Webb and Leibniz once speculated that Chinese might, in fact, have once been universally intelligible due to its ideogrammatic nature, but Percy debunks this by arguing Chinese is a derivative of Egyptian hieroglyphs. My point being, these things are contingent. Dominant languages might keep a little staying power even after their armies decline \u2013 Portuguese, for instance, has far outstayed its welcome \u2013 but they always fade from relevance eventually.",
    "But I do think there is a pure realm of meaning \u2013 a language in between, where all concepts are perfectly expressed, which we have not been able to approximate. There is a sense, a feeling of when we have got it right.\u2019.",
    "\u2018Like Voltaire,\u2019 Robin said, emboldened by his wine and rather excited that he could remember the relevant quote. \u2018Like what he writes in his preface to his translation of Shakespeare. I have tried to soar with the author where he soars.\u2019",
    "\u2018Quite right,\u2019 said Professor Lovell. \u2018But how does Frere put it? The language of translation ought, we think, as far as possible, to be a pure, impalpable, and invisible element, the medium of thought and feeling, and nothing more. But what do we know of thought and feeling except as expressed through language?\u2019",
    "\u2018Is that what powers the silver bars?\u2019 Robin asked. This conversation was starting to get away from him; he sensed a depth to Professor Lovell\u2019s theorizing into which he wasn\u2019t prepared to follow, and he needed to bring things back to the material before he got lost. \u2018Do they work by capturing that pure meaning \u2013 whatever gets lost when we invoke it through crude approximations?\u2019",
    "Professor Lovell nodded. \u2018It is as close to a theoretical explanation as we can get. But I also think that as languages evolve, as their speakers become more worldly and sophisticated, as they gorge on other concepts and swell and morph to encompass more over time \u2013 we approach something close to that language. There\u2019s less room for misunderstanding. And we\u2019ve only begun to work out what that means for silver-working.\u2019",
    "He was only joking, but Professor Lovell nodded vigorously at this. \u2018You\u2019re quite right. French, Italian, and Spanish dominate the faculty, but their new contributions to the silver-working ledgers dwindle by the year. There\u2019s simply too much communication across the continent. Too many loanwords. Connotations change and converge as French and Spanish grow closer to English, and vice versa. Decades from now, the silver bars we use from Romance languages might no longer have any effect. No, if we want to innovate, then we must look to the East. We need languages that aren\u2019t spoken in Europe.\u2019",
    "\u2018Who\u2019s been gossiping to you about departmental politics?\u2019 Professor Lovell chuckled. \u2018Yes, there are hurt feelings this year because we only took one Classicist, and a woman at that. But that\u2019s how it has to be. The cohort above you are going to have a tough time finding jobs.\u2019",
    "\u2018But Britain is the only place where I\u2019ve ever seen silver bars in wide use,\u2019 said Robin. \u2018They\u2019re not nearly so popular in Canton, or, I\u2019ve heard, in Calcutta. And it strikes me \u2013 I don\u2019t know, it seems a bit strange that the British are the only ones who get to use them when the Chinese and Indians are contributing the crucial components of their functioning.\u2019",
    "\u2018But that\u2019s simple economics,\u2019 said Professor Lovell. \u2018It takes a great deal of cash to purchase what we create. The British happen to be able to afford it. We have deals with Chinese and Indian merchants too, but they\u2019re often less able to pay the export fees.\u2019",
    "He was playing a dangerous game, he knew. But he had to seek clarity. He could not construct Professor Lovell and all his colleagues as the enemy in his mind, could not wholly buy into Griffin\u2019s damning assessment of Babel, without some confirmation.",
    "Robin tried a different line of argument. \u2018It\u2019s just that \u2013 well, it only seems fair there ought to be some kind of exchange.\u2019 He was regretting now that he\u2019d drunk so much. He felt loose, vulnerable. Too passionate for what should have been an intellectual discussion. \u2018We take their languages, their ways of seeing and describing the world. We ought to give them something in return.\u2019",
    "\u2018But language,\u2019 said Professor Lovell, \u2018is not like a commercial good, like tea or silks, to be bought and paid for. Language is an infinite resource. And if we learn it, if we use it \u2013 who are we stealing from?\u2019",
    "There was some logic in this, but the conclusion still made Robin uncomfortable. Surely things were not so simple; surely this still masked some unfair coercion or exploitation. But he could not formulate an objection, could not figure out where the fault in the argument lay.",
    "\u2018The Qing Emperor has one of the largest silver reserves in the world,\u2019 said Professor Lovell. \u2018He has plenty of scholars. He even has linguists who understand English. So why doesn\u2019t he fill his court with silver bars? Why is it that the Chinese, rich as their language is, have no grammars of their own?\u2019",
    "\u2018Or that you\u2019re hoarding knowledge that should be freely shared,\u2019 said Robin. \u2018Because if language is free, if knowledge is free, then why are all the Grammaticas under lock and key in the tower? Why don\u2019t we ever host foreign scholars, or send scholars to help open translation centres elsewhere in the world?\u2019",
    "\u2018Well, I\u2019m sorry about your mother.\u2019 Professor Lovell picked up his knife and began cutting into his steak. He seemed flustered, discomfited. \u2018But the Asiatic Cholera was a product of Canton\u2019s poor public hygiene, not the unequal distribution of bars. And anyhow, there\u2019s no silver match-pair that can bring back the dead\u2014\u2019",
    "The doorbell rang. Robin flinched; his fork clattered against his plate and fell to the floor. He scooped it up, deeply embarrassed. Mrs Piper\u2019s voice carried down the hall. \u2018Oh, what a surprise! They\u2019re having dinner now, I\u2019ll bring you in\u2014\u2019 and then a blond, handsome, and elegantly dressed gentleman strode into the dining room, bearing a stack of books in his hand.",
    "\u2018Welcome, anyhow.\u2019 He said this like an afterthought; he had already turned his back on Robin, and the words sounded forced and awkward. He set the books on the table. \u2018You were right, Dick, it\u2019s precisely the Ricci dictionaries that are the key. We\u2019ve been missing what happens when we go through Portuguese. That, I can help with. Now I think if we daisy-chain the characters I\u2019ve marked here, and here\u2014\u2019",
    "He looked on, feeling tipsy and out of place. His cheeks burned. He had not finished his food, but it seemed very awkward to keep eating now. He had no appetite besides. His earlier confidence vanished. He felt again like a stupid little boy, laughed away and dismissed by those crow-like visitors in Professor Lovell\u2019s sitting room.",
    "And he wondered at the contradiction: that he despised them, that he knew they could be up to no good, and that still he wanted to be respected by them enough to be included in their ranks. It was a very strange mix of emotions. He hadn\u2019t the faintest idea how to sort through them.",
    "He felt his chest constrict, as if his heart were a caged beast straining to burst out. That was curious. This dismissal was nothing he hadn\u2019t experienced before. Professor Lovell had never acknowledged Robin\u2019s feelings, or offered care or comfort, only abruptly changed the subject, only thrown up a cold, indifferent wall, only minimized Robin\u2019s hurts so that it seemed frivolous to bring them up at all. Robin had grown used to it by now.",
    "Only now \u2013 perhaps because of the wine, or perhaps it had all been building up for so long that things were past the tipping point \u2013 he felt he wanted to scream. Cry. Kick the wall. Anything, if only to make his father look him in the face.",
    "Instead he went further and passed into the grounds of Merton College. At night, the gardens were twisted and eerie; black branches reached like fingers from behind a bolted iron gate. Robin fiddled uselessly with the lock, then hauled himself panting over a narrow gap between the spikes. He wandered a few feet into the garden before realizing he did not know what a birch looked like.",
    "He stepped back and glanced around, feeling rather foolish. Then a patch of white caught his eye \u2013 a pale tree, surrounded by a cluster of mulberry bushes, trimmed to curl slightly upwards as if in adulation. A knob protruded from the white tree\u2019s trunk; in the moonlight, it looked like a bald head. A crystal ball.",
    "He wondered at the hot coil in his chest. The long, sobering walk had not dimmed his anger. He still felt ready to scream. Had dinner with his father infuriated him so? Was this the righteous indignation that Griffin spoke of? But what he felt was not as simple as revolutionary flame. What he felt in his heart was not conviction so much as doubt, resentment, and a deep confusion.",
    "He hated this place. He loved it. He resented how it treated him. He still wanted to be a part of it \u2013 because it felt so good to be a part of it, to speak to its professors as an intellectual equal, to be in on the great game.",
    "One nasty thought crept into his mind \u2013 It\u2019s because you\u2019re a wounded little boy, and you wish they had paid you more attention \u2013 but he pushed this away. Surely he could not be so petty; surely he was not merely lashing out at his father because he felt dismissed.",
    "He ran his finger over the wood. His nails would not do. A knife would have been ideal, but he\u2019d never carried one. At last, he pulled a fountain pen from his pocket and pressed the tip into the knob. The wood gave purchase. He scratched hard several times to make the cross visible \u2013 his fingers ached, and the nib was irreversibly ruined \u2013 but at last he left his mark.",
    "The following Monday, Robin returned to his room after class to find a slip of paper wedged under his windowsill. He snatched it up. Heart hammering, he shut his door and sat down on the floor, squinting at Griffin\u2019s cramped handwriting.",
    "The note was in Chinese. Robin read it twice, then backwards, then forwards again, perplexed. Griffin seemed to have strung together characters utterly at random and the sentences did not make sense \u2013 no, they could not even be described as sentences, for although there was punctuation, the characters were arranged without care for grammar or syntax. This was a cipher, surely, but Griffin had not given Robin a key, and Robin could think of no literary allusions or subtle hints Griffin might have dropped to help him decode this nonsense.",
    "At last he realized he was going about it all wrong. This was not Chinese. Griffin had merely used Chinese characters to convey words in a language Robin suspected was English. He ripped a sheet of paper from his diary, placed it next to Griffin\u2019s note, and wrote out the romanization of each character. Some of the words took guesswork, since romanized Chinese words had very different spelling patterns to English words, but in the end, through working out several common change patterns \u2013 t\u00e8 always meant \u2018the\u2019, \u00fc was oo \u2013 Robin broke the code.",
    "Robin read the note again and again until he\u2019d committed the details to memory, then tossed both the original and his decryption into the fireplace, watching intently until every scrap had shrivelled to ash.",
    "On Wednesday, it poured. It had been misty all afternoon, and Robin had watched the darkening sky with accumulating dread. When he left Professor Chakravarti\u2019s office at six, a soft drizzle was slowly turning the pavement grey. By the time he reached Magpie Lane, the rain had thickened to a steady patter.",
    "By half past eleven, the rain had announced its permanence. It was the kind of rain that sounded cold; even in the absence of vicious winds, snow, or hail, the very pattering against cobblestones felt like cubes of ice hammering against one\u2019s skin. Robin saw now the reasoning behind Griffin\u2019s instructions \u2013 on a night like this, you couldn\u2019t see more than a few feet past your own nose, and even if you could, you wouldn\u2019t care to look. Rain like this made you walk with your head down, shoulders hunched, indifferent to the world until you got to somewhere warm.",
    "My readings, Robin almost said, but that couldn\u2019t be right, because he\u2019d purportedly been working on them all night. \u2018Ah \u2013 just my diary. It\u2019ll keep me up if I leave it, I\u2019m nervous about anyone seeing my notes\u2014\u2019",
    "The punishing rainfall made the ten-minute walk up High Street feel like an eternity. Babel shone in the distance like a warm candle, each floor still fully lit as if it were the middle of the afternoon, though hardly any silhouettes were visible through the windows. Babel\u2019s scholars worked round the clock, but most took their books home with them by nine or ten, and anyone still there at midnight was not likely to leave the tower until morning.",
    "When he reached the green, he paused and peered around. He saw no one. Griffin\u2019s letter had been so vague; he didn\u2019t know if he should wait until he glimpsed one of the Hermes operatives, or if he should go ahead and follow his orders precisely.",
    "The bells rang for midnight. He hurried up to the entrance, mouth dry, breathless. When he reached the stone steps, two figures materialized from the darkness \u2013 both black-clad youths whose faces he could not make out in the rain.",
    "Robin pulled the door open and paused for the briefest moment on the doorstep, just long enough for the figures behind him to slink into the tower. He never saw their faces. They dashed up the staircase like wraiths, quick and silent. Robin stood in the foyer, shivering as rain dripped down his forehead, watching the clock as the seconds ticked towards the five-minute mark.",
    "It was all so easy. When the time came, Robin turned and strode out the door. He felt a slight bump at his waist, but otherwise perceived nothing: no whispers, no clinks of silver bars. The Hermes operatives were swallowed by the dark. In seconds, it was as if they had never been there at all.",
    "He slept badly. He kept tossing in his bed in a nightmarish fugue, soaking his sheets with sweat, tortured by half dreams, anxious extrapolations in which the police kicked down his door and dragged him off to gaol, declaring they\u2019d seen everything and knew everything. He did not fall properly asleep until the early morning, and by then he was so exhausted he missed the morning bells. He did not awake until the scout knocked at his door, asking if he\u2019d like his floors swept that day.",
    "\u2018Oh \u2013 yes, sorry, just give me a moment and I\u2019ll be out.\u2019 He splashed water on his face, dressed, and dashed out the door. His cohort had arranged to meet in a study room on the fifth floor to compare their translations before class, and now he was terribly late.",
    "\u2018There you are,\u2019 said Ramy when he arrived. He, Letty, and Victoire were all seated around a square table. \u2018I\u2019m sorry I left without you, but I thought you\u2019d gone already \u2013 I knocked twice but you never answered.\u2019",
    "He\u2019d feared he would never sit through the entire meeting. But somehow, the warm sunlight against the cool wood, the scratch of ink against parchment, and Letty\u2019s crisp, clear dictation pulled his exhausted mind into focus, made Latin, not his impending expulsion, seem like the most pressing order of the day.",
    "The study meeting turned out much livelier than expected. Robin, who was used to reading his translations out loud to Mr Chester, who drolly corrected him as he went, was not anticipating such hearty debate over turns of phrase, punctuation, or how much repetition was too much. It quickly became apparent they had drastically different translation styles.",
    "Letty, who was a stickler for grammatical structures that adhered to the Latin as much as possible, seemed ready to forgive the most astoundingly awkward manipulations of prose, while Ramy, her polar opposite, was always ready to abandon technical accuracy for rhetorical flourishes he insisted would better deliver the point, even when this meant insertion of completely novel clauses.",
    "Victoire seemed constantly frustrated with the limits of English \u2013 \u2018It\u2019s so awkward, French would suit this better\u2019 \u2013 and Letty always vehemently agreed, which made Ramy snort, at which point the topic of Ovid was abandoned for a repeat of the Napoleonic Wars..",
    "He was, actually. It felt good to sink into the refuge of a dead language, to fight a rhetorical war whose stakes could not really touch him. He was astonished by how ordinary the rest of the day felt, how calmly he could sit among his cohort as Professor Playfair lectured and pretend that Tytler was the foremost subject on his mind. In the light of day, the exploits of last night seemed a faraway dream. The tangible and solid consisted of Oxford, of coursework and professors and freshly baked scones and clotted cream.",
    "Still, he could not erase the lurking dread that this was all a cruel joke, that the curtains would come down any minute on this charade. For how could there not be some consequence? Such an act of betrayal \u2013 of stealing from Babel itself, the institution to which he\u2019d literally given his blood \u2013 should surely have made this life impossible.",
    "Anxiety hit him properly midafternoon. What had last night seemed like such a thrilling, righteous mission now seemed incredibly stupid. He couldn\u2019t focus on Latin; Professor Craft had to snap her fingers in front of his eyes before he realized she\u2019d asked him three times over to scan a line. He kept imagining horrible scenarios with vivid detail \u2013 how the constables would burst in, point, and yell, There he is, the thief; how his cohort would stare, stunned; how Professor Lovell, who was for some reason both prosecutor and judge, would coldly sentence Robin to the noose.",
    "But the visions remained only that. No one came to arrest him. Their class proceeded slowly, blandly, uninterrupted. His terror faded. By the time Robin and his cohort reassembled in hall for supper, he found it astonishingly easy to pretend to himself that last night had never happened. And once they were seated with their food \u2013 cold potatoes and steak so tough it took all their might to hack off chewable bits \u2013 laughing at Professor Craft\u2019s irritated corrections of Ramy\u2019s embellished translations, it indeed felt like only a distant memory.",
    "A new note awaited him under the windowsill when he returned home that night. He unfolded it with shaking hands. The message scrawled within was very brief, and this time Robin managed to decode it in his head.",
    "His disappointment confused him. Hadn\u2019t he spent the day wishing he\u2019d never been ensnared in this nightmare? He could just imagine Griffin\u2019s mocking voice \u2013 What, did you want a pat on the back? A biscuit for a job well done?",
    "He now found himself hoping for more. But he had no way of knowing when he might hear from Griffin again. Griffin had warned Robin their contact would be sporadic, that entire terms might pass before he was in touch again. Robin would be summoned when he was needed, and no sooner. He found no note at his windowsill the next evening, or the evening after that.",
    "It turned out this was very easy to do. As the memories of Griffin and Hermes receded into the back of his mind, into nightmares and the dark, his life at Oxford and at Babel rose to the forefront in glaring, dazzling colour.",
    "It stunned him, how quickly he fell in love with the place and the people. He hadn\u2019t even noticed it happening. His first term had him spinning in place, dazed and exhausted; his classes and coursework formed a rote pattern of frenzied readings and late, bleary-eyed nights against which his cohort was his only source of joy and solace. The girls, bless them, quickly forgave Robin and Ramy for their first impressions.",
    "Robin discovered he and Victoire shared the same unabashed love of literature of all kinds from Gothic horrors to romances, and they took great pleasure in swapping and discussing the latest batch of penny dreadfuls brought in from London. And Letty, once she\u2019d been persuaded the boys were indeed not too stupid to be at Oxford, became a great deal more tolerable. She turned out to possess both an acerbic wit and a keen understanding of the British class structure by virtue of her upbringing, which made for infinitely amusing commentary when it wasn\u2019t aimed at either of them..",
    "\u2018Colin\u2019s the sort of bottom-feeding middle-class leech who likes to pretend he\u2019s got connections because his family knows a mathematics tutor in Cambridge,\u2019 she would say after a visit to Magpie Lane. \u2018If he wants to be a solicitor, he could just get an apprenticeship at the Inns of Court, but he\u2019s here because he wants the prestige and connections, only he\u2019s not half charming enough to acquire them. He\u2019s got the personality of a wet towel: damp, and he clings.\u2019",
    "Ramy, Victoire, and Letty \u2013 they became the colours of Robin\u2019s life, the only regular contact he had with the world outside his coursework. They needed each other because they had no one else. The older students at Babel were aggressively insular; they were too busy, too intimidatingly brilliant and impressive. Two weeks into the term Letty boldly asked a graduate fellow named Gabriel if she might join the French reading group, but was swiftly rejected with the particular disdain only the French could muster.",
    "Robin tried to befriend a Japanese third-year student named Ilse Dejima,* who spoke with a faint Dutch accent. They crossed paths often on their ways in and out of Professor Chakravarti\u2019s office, but the few times he tried to say hello to her she made a face as if he were mud on her boots..",
    "They tried to befriend the second-year cohort, too, a group of five white boys who lived just across the way on Merton Street. But this went south immediately when one of them, Philip Wright, told Robin at a faculty dinner that the first-year cohort was largely international only because of departmental politics. \u2018The board of undergraduate studies is always fighting over whether to prioritize European languages, or other . . . more exotic languages. Chakravarti and Lovell have been making a stink about diversifying the student body for years.",
    "Ramy would adore that purple scarf hanging in the window of Ede & Ravenscroft; Letty would laugh herself silly at the puppy-eyed young man sitting outside Queen\u2019s Lane Coffeehouse with a book of sonnets; Victoire would be so excited that a new batch of scones had just been put out at Vaults & Garden but because she would be stuck in her French tutorial until noon, Robin absolutely had to buy one, wrap it up in his pocket, and save it for her for when class was let out.",
    "They were not without their rifts. They argued endlessly, the way bright young people with well-fed egos and too many opinions do. Robin and Victoire had a long-running debate over the superiority of English versus French literature, wherein both were oddly, fiercely loyal to their adopted countries.",
    "Victoire insisted that England\u2019s best theorists could not hold a candle to Voltaire or Diderot, and Robin would have given her the benefit of the doubt if only she didn\u2019t keep scoffing at the translations he took out from the Bodleian on the grounds that \u2018They\u2019re nothing compared to the original, you might as well not read it at all.\u2019 Victoire and Letty, though normally quite close, seemed to always get snippy on issues of money and whether Letty truly counted as poor as she claimed to be just because her father had cut her off.* And Letty and Ramy bickered most of all, largely over Ramy\u2019s claim that Letty had never stepped foot in the colonies and therefore shouldn\u2019t opine on the supposed benefits of the British presence in India..",
    "At which point Letty would always get defensive, sullen, and irritable until the next day. But this was not entirely her fault. Ramy seemed particularly determined to provoke her, to dismantle her every assertion. Proud, proper Letty with her stiff upper lip represented everything Ramy disdained about the English, and Robin suspected Ramy would not be satisfied until he\u2019d got Letty to declare treason against her own country.",
    "Still, their fights could not really pull them apart. Rather, these arguments only drew them closer together, sharpened their edges, and defined the ways they fitted differently into the puzzle of their cohort. They spent all their time together. On weekends, they sat at a corner table outside the Vaults & Garden caf\u00e9, interrogating Letty on the oddities of English, of which only she was a native speaker. (\u2018What does corned mean?\u2019 Robin would demand.",
    "\u2018What is corned beef? What are you all doing to your beef?\u2019* \u2018And what is a welcher?\u2019* Victoire would ask, looking up from her latest penny serial. \u2018Letitia, please, what in God\u2019s name is a jigger-dubber?\u2019*).",
    "When Ramy complained that the food in hall was so bad that he was visibly dropping weight (this was true; the Univ kitchens, when they weren\u2019t serving the same rotation of tough boiled meat, unsalted roast vegetables, and indistinguishable pottages, put out inexplicable and inedible dishes with names like \u2018India Pickle\u2019, \u2018Turtle Dressed the West India Way\u2019, and something called \u2018China Chilo\u2019, very little of which was halal), they stole into the kitchen and cobbled a dish out of chickpeas, potatoes, and an assortment of spices Ramy had scrounged together from Oxford\u2019s markets.",
    "The result was a lumpy scarlet stew so spicy that they all felt like they\u2019d been punched in the nose. Ramy refused to accept defeat; instead, he argued, this was further proof of his grand thesis that there was something fundamentally wrong with the British, since if they\u2019d been able to get their hands on real turmeric and mustard seeds then the dish would have tasted much better..",
    "Letty, sniffling miserably, refused to take another bite. Robin and Victoire stoically kept shovelling spoonfuls into their mouths. Ramy told them they were all cowards \u2013 in Calcutta, he claimed, infants could eat ghost peppers without batting an eye. But even he had trouble finishing the fiery-red mass on his plate.",
    "Robin didn\u2019t realize what he had, what he\u2019d been searching for and had finally obtained, until one night halfway through the term when they were all in Victoire\u2019s rooms. Hers were improbably the largest of any of their quarters because none of the other boarders wanted to share with her, which meant not only did she have a bedroom all to herself but also the bathroom and the spacious sitting room where they\u2019d taken to congregating to finish their coursework after the Bodleian closed at nine.",
    "That night they were playing cards, not studying, because Professor Craft was in London for a conference, which meant they had the evening off. But the cards were soon forgotten because an intense stench of ripe pears suddenly pervaded the room and none of them could figure out what it was, because they hadn\u2019t been eating pears, and because Victoire swore she didn\u2019t have any stashed away in her room..",
    "Then Victoire was rolling on the ground, both laughing and shrieking because Letty kept screaming, \u2018Where is the pear? Where is it, Victoire? Where is the pear?\u2019 Ramy made a joke about the Spanish Inquisition, so Letty, playing along, ordered Victoire to turn out all her coat pockets to prove none of them concealed the core. Victoire obeyed but turned up nothing, which sent them into further shrieks of hysterics.",
    "And Robin sat at the table, watching them, smiling as he waited for the card game to resume until he realized that it wouldn\u2019t because they were all laughing too much and, besides, Ramy\u2019s cards were splayed across the floor face-up, so continuing was pointless. Then he blinked, because he\u2019d just registered what this most mundane and extraordinary moment meant \u2013 that in the space of several weeks, they had become what he\u2019d never found in Hampstead, what he thought he\u2019d never have again after Canton: a circle of people he loved so fiercely his chest hurt when he thought about them..",
    "He adored it here; he really did. For all the daily slights he suffered, walking through campus delighted him. He simply could not maintain, as Griffin did, an attitude of constant suspicion or rebellion; he could not acquire Griffin\u2019s hatred of this place.",
    "Yet didn\u2019t he have a right to be happy? He had never felt such warmth in his chest until now, had never looked forward to getting up in the morning as he did now. Babel, his friends, and Oxford \u2013 they had unlocked a part of him, a place of sunshine and belonging, that he never thought he\u2019d feel again. The world felt less dark.",
    "Later, it would amaze Robin that it never seriously crossed his mind to tell any of them about the Hermes Society. After all, by the end of Michaelmas term, he had come to trust them with his life; he had no doubt that if he fell into the frozen Isis, any one of them would have dived in to save him. Yet Griffin and the Hermes Society belonged to bad dreams and shadows; his cohort was sun and warmth and laughter, and he could not imagine bringing those worlds together.",
    "Only once was he ever tempted to say something. At lunch one day, Ramy and Letty were arguing \u2013 once again \u2013 over the British presence in India. Ramy regarded the occupation of Bengal as an ongoing travesty; Letty thought the British victory at Plassey was more than fair retaliation for what she considered the horrific treatment of hostages by Siraj-ud-daulah, and that the British need never have intervened if the Mughals had not been such terrible rulers.",
    "\u2018Yes, where \u201cqualified\u201d means an elite class that speaks English and acts like toadies to the British,\u2019 said Ramy. \u2018We\u2019re not being ruled, we\u2019re being misruled. What\u2019s happening to my country is nothing short of robbery. It\u2019s not open trade; it\u2019s financial bleeding, it\u2019s looting, and sacking. We\u2019ve never needed their help, and they\u2019ve only constructed that narrative out of a misplaced sense of superiority.\u2019",
    "\u2018Ah, to acquire the weapons to bring down the Empire?\u2019 She scoffed. \u2018You\u2019re going to take some silver bars home and start a revolution, are you? Shall we march into Babel and declare your intentions?\u2019",
    "\u2018Oh, really?\u2019 Letty had found the spot where it hurt; now she was like a dog with a bone and she wouldn\u2019t let go. \u2018Because it seems to me that the fact that you\u2019re here, enjoying an English education, is precisely what makes the English superior. Unless there\u2019s a better language institute in Calcutta?\u2019",
    "But he stopped himself before he opened his mouth. Not because he was afraid of breaking Griffin\u2019s confidence, but because he could not bear how this confession would shatter the life they\u2019d built for themselves. And because he himself could not resolve the contradiction of his willingness to thrive at Babel even as it became clearer, day by day, how obviously unjust were the foundations of its fortunes.",
    "The only way he could justify his happiness here, to keep dancing on the edges of two worlds, was to continue awaiting Griffin\u2019s correspondence at night \u2013 a hidden, silent rebellion whose main purpose was to assuage his guilt over the fact that all this gold and glitter had to come at a cost..",
    "We then used to consider it not the least vulgar for a parcel of lads who had been whipped three months previous, and were not allowed more than three glasses of port at home, to sit down to pineapples and ices at each other\u2019s rooms, and fuddle themselves with champagne and claret.",
    "In the last weeks of November, Robin assisted in three more thefts for the Hermes Society. They all followed the efficient, clockwork routine of the first \u2013 a note by his windowsill, a rainy night, a midnight rendezvous, and minimal contact with his accomplices save for a quick glance and nod. He never got a closer look at the other operatives. He didn\u2019t know if they were the same people every time. He never found out what they stole or what they used it for.",
    "He kept hoping that Griffin would summon him for another chat outside the Twisted Root, but it seemed his half-brother was too busy leading a global organization of which Robin was only a very small part.",
    "Robin was nearly caught during his fourth theft, when a third year named Cathy O\u2019Nell strode through the front door as he was waiting in the foyer. Cathy was, unfortunately, one of the chattier upperclassmen; she specialized in Gaelic, and perhaps due to the sheer loneliness of being one of two people in her subfield, she went out of her way to befriend everyone in the faculty.",
    "\u2018Is he making you compare translations in class?\u2019 Cathy asked. \u2018Once he interrogated me for nearly half an hour over my word choice of red instead of apple-like. I\u2019d nearly sweated through my shirt by the end.\u2019",
    "\u2018Sure. I will do \u2013 bye.\u2019 He felt awful being so curt. She was so nice, and such offers were particularly generous coming from the upperclassmen. But all he could think of then was his accomplices upstairs, and what might happen if they came down at the same time that Cathy went up.",
    "A more cautious personality would have quit Hermes then, would not have risked his entire future on such razor-thin possibilities. But Robin did go back to do it again. He assisted in a fifth theft, and then a sixth. Michaelmas term ended, the winter holidays sped by, and Hilary term began. His heartbeat no longer pounded in his ears when he approached the tower at midnight. The minutes between entrance and exit no longer felt like purgatory.",
    "A week into Hilary term, Griffin had finally deigned to meet Robin again in person. Once more they strode briskly around Oxford, this time following the Thames down south towards Kennington. The meeting felt like a midterm progress report with a harsh and rarely available supervisor, and Robin found himself basking in the praise, trying and failing not to come off as a giddy kid brother.",
    "They walked in silence for a stretch. There had been a storm just that morning. The Isis flowed fast and loud under a misty, darkening sky. It was the kind of evening when the world seemed drained of colour, a painting in progress, a sketch really, existing in greys and shadows only.",
    "\u2018Of course it\u2019s unsustainable,\u2019 said Griffin. \u2018You\u2019ll study hard and graduate, and then they\u2019ll ask you to do all kinds of unsavoury things for the Empire. Or they\u2019ll catch you, as you said. It all comes to a head eventually, like it did for us.\u2019",
    "Robin was not sure how to feel about this. He often lulled himself into the fantasy of the post-Babel life \u2013 a cushy fellowship, if he wanted it; a guarantee of more fully funded years of study in those gorgeous libraries, living in comfortable college housing and tutoring rich undergraduates in Latin if he wanted extra pocket money; or an exciting career travelling overseas with the book buyers and simultaneous interpreters. In the Zhuangzi, which he\u2019d just translated with Professor Chakravarti, the phrase t\u01cent\u00fa* literally meant \u2018a flat road\u2019, metaphorically, \u2018a tranquil life\u2019.",
    "\u2018You\u2019ll remain at Babel as long as you\u2019re able,\u2019 said Griffin. \u2018I mean, you ought to \u2013 heaven knows, we need more people on the inside. But it gets harder and harder, you see. You\u2019ll find you can\u2019t reconcile your sense of ethics with what they ask you to do. What happens when they direct you to military research? When they send you to the frontier in New Zealand, or the Cape Colony?\u2019",
    "Griffin laughed. \u2018Military contracts compose over half of the work orders. They\u2019re a necessary part of the tenure application. And they pay well too \u2013 most of the senior faculty got rich fighting Napoleon. How do you think dear old Dad\u2019s able to maintain three houses? It\u2019s violent work that sustains the fantasy.\u2019",
    "\u2018About five years ago, yes. You will too, eventually. And then you\u2019ll become a shadow on the campus you once had the run of, and pray that some other first year will find it in their conscience to grant you access to your old libraries.\u2019 Griffin shot him a sideways look. \u2018You\u2019re not happy with this answer, are you?\u2019",
    "Robin hesitated. He wasn\u2019t quite sure how to verbalize his discomfort. Yes, there was a certain appeal to abandoning the Oxford life for Hermes. He wanted to do what Griffin did; he wanted access to Hermes\u2019s inner workings, wanted to see where the stolen bars went and what was done with them. He wanted to see the hidden world.",
    "\u2018Your tutors had you read Varro, didn\u2019t they? He describes a glirarium in the Res Rustica.* It\u2019s quite an elegant contraption. You make a jar, only it\u2019s perforated with holes so the dormice can breathe, and the surfaces are polished so smooth that escape is impossible. You put food in the hollows, and you make sure there are some ledges and walkways so the dormice don\u2019t get too bored. Most importantly, you keep it dark, so the dormice always think it\u2019s time to hibernate. All they do is sleep and fatten themselves up.\u2019",
    "How could he explain it? Babel represented more than material comforts. Babel was the reason he belonged in England, why he was not begging on the streets of Canton. Babel was the only place where his talents mattered. Babel was security. And perhaps all that was morally compromised, yes \u2013 but was it so wrong to want to survive?",
    "\u2018Don\u2019t trouble yourself,\u2019 said Griffin. \u2018No one\u2019s asking you to leave Oxford. It\u2019s not prudent, strategically speaking. See, I\u2019m free, and I\u2019m happy on the outside, but I also can\u2019t get into the tower. We\u2019re trapped in a symbiotic relationship with the levers of power. We need their silver. We need their tools. And, loath as we are to admit it, we benefit from their research.\u2019",
    "He gave Robin a shove. It was meant as a fraternal gesture, but neither of them was very practised at those, and it came off as more threatening than perhaps Griffin intended. \u2018You do your reading and you stay on the inside. Don\u2019t you worry about the contradiction. Your guilt is assuaged, for now. Enjoy your glirarium, little dormouse.\u2019",
    "Griffin left him at the corner of Woodstock. Robin watched his narrow frame disappear into the streets, his coat flapping around him like the wings of a giant bird, and wondered at how he could both admire and resent someone so much at the same time.",
    "In Classical Chinese, the characters \u4e8c\u5fc3 referred to disloyal or traitorous intentions; literally, they translated as \u2018two hearts\u2019. And Robin found himself in the impossible position of loving that which he betrayed, twice.",
    "He did adore Oxford, and his life at Oxford. It was very nice to be among the Babblers, who were in many ways the most privileged group of students there. If they flaunted their Babel affiliation, they were allowed in any of the college libraries, including the absurdly gorgeous Codrington, which didn\u2019t actually hold any reference materials they needed, but which they haunted regardless because its high walls and marble floors made them feel so very grand. All their living expenses were taken care of. Unlike the other servitors, they never had to serve food in hall or clean tutors\u2019 rooms.",
    "Their room, board, and tuition were paid directly by Babel, so they never even saw the bill \u2013 on top of that, they received their stipend of twenty shillings a month, and were also given access to a discretionary fund they could use to purchase whatever course materials they liked. If they could make even the flimsiest case that a gold-capped fountain pen would aid their studies, then Babel paid for it..",
    "\u2018I\u2019ve got a few things I can pawn to make up the difference until next month. Or I\u2019ll pass on a few meals until then.\u2019 Jameson glanced up. He looked desperately uncomfortable. \u2018I say, and I do hate to ask, but do you think\u2014\u2019",
    "\u2018Don\u2019t mention it.\u2019 Robin reached into his pocket, pulled out his purse, and began counting out coins. He felt awfully pretentious as he did this \u2013 he\u2019d just retrieved his stipend from the bursar that morning, and he hoped Jameson did not think he always walked around with such a stuffed purse. \u2018Would that cover meals, at least?\u2019",
    "They did. Not only was Babel very rich, it was also respected. Theirs was by far the most prestigious faculty at Oxford. It was Babel that new undergraduates bragged about when showing their visiting relatives around campus. It was a Babel student who invariably won Oxford\u2019s yearly Chancellor\u2019s Prize, given to the best composition of Latin verse, as well as the Kennicott Hebrew Scholarship. It was Babel undergraduates who were invited to special receptions* with the politicians, aristocrats, and the unimaginably wealthy who made up the lobby clientele.",
    "Once it was rumoured that Princess Victoria herself would be in attendance at the faculty\u2019s annual garden party; this turned out to be false, but she did give them a new marble fountain which was installed on the green a week later, and which Professor Playfair enchanted to shoot high, glistening arcs of water at all hours of the day..",
    "By the middle of Hilary term, like every Babel cohort before them, Robin, Ramy, Victoire, and Letty had absorbed the insufferable superiority of scholars who knew they had the run of campus. They took much amusement in how visiting scholars, who either condescended to or ignored them in hall, started fawning and shaking their hands when they revealed they studied translation.",
    "They dropped mention of how they had access to the Senior Common Room, which was both very nice and inaccessible to other undergraduates, though in truth they rarely spent much time there, as it was difficult to have a plain conversation when an ancient, wrinkled don sat snoring in the corner..",
    "Victoire and Letty, who now understood that the presence of women at Oxford was more of an open secret than an outright taboo, began slowly growing out their hair. One day Letty even appeared in hall for dinner wearing a skirt instead of trousers. The Univ boys whispered and pointed, but the staff said nothing, and she was served her three courses and wine without incident.",
    "But there were also significant ways in which they did not belong. No one would serve Ramy at any of their favourite pubs if he was the first to arrive. Letty and Victoire could not take books out of the library without a male student present to vouch for them. Victoire was assumed by shopkeepers to be Letty or Robin\u2019s maid. Porters regularly asked all four of them if they could please not step on the green for it was off limits, while the other boys trampled over the so-called delicate grass all around them.",
    "What\u2019s more, it took them all several months to learn to speak like Oxfordians. Oxford English was different from London English, and was developed largely by the undergraduate tendency to corrupt and abbreviate just about everything. Magdalene was pronounced maudlin; by the same token, St Aldate\u2019s had become St Old\u2019s. The Magna Vacatio became the Long Vacation became the Long. New College became New; St Edmund\u2019s became Teddy. It took months before Robin was used to uttering \u2018Univ\u2019 when he meant \u2018University College\u2019.",
    "None of them could quite understand the particular etiquette of calling cards, for instance, or how it was that one wormed oneself into the social ecosystem of the college in the first place, or how the many distinct but overlapping tiers of said ecosystem worked.* They were always hearing rumours of wild parties, nights at the pub spinning out of control, secret society meetings, and teas where so-and-so had been devastatingly rude to his tutor or where so-and-so had insulted someone else\u2019s sister, but they never witnessed these events in person..",
    "They were decidedly not college royalty. Not even the white Babblers in the years above them were college royalty, for Babel kept them all too busy with coursework to enjoy a social life. That label could only describe a second year at Univ named Elton Pendennis and his friends. They were all gentlemen-commoners, which meant they\u2019d paid higher fees to the university to avoid entrance examinations and to enjoy the privileges of fellows of the college.",
    "They sat at high table in hall, they lodged in apartments far nicer than the Magpie Lane dormitories, and they played snooker in the Senior Common Room whenever they liked. They enjoyed hunting, tennis, and billiards at the weekends and headed to London by coach every month for dinner parties and balls. They never did their shopping on High Street; all the newest fashions and cigars and accessories were brought straight from London to their quarters by salesmen who did not even bother quoting prices..",
    "Letty, who\u2019d grown up around boys like Pendennis, made him and his friends the target of a running stream of vituperation. \u2018Rich boys studying on their father\u2019s money. I bet they\u2019ve never cracked open a textbook in their lives. I don\u2019t know why Elton thinks he\u2019s so handsome. Those lips are girlish; he shouldn\u2019t pout so. Those double-breasted purple jackets look ridiculous. And I don\u2019t know why he keeps telling everyone that he has an understanding with Clara Lilly. I know Clara and she\u2019s as good as engaged to the Woolcotts\u2019 oldest boy . . .\u2019",
    "Still, Robin could not help but envy those boys \u2013 those born into this world, who uttered its codes as native speakers. When he saw Elton Pendennis and his crowd strolling and laughing across the green, he couldn\u2019t help but imagine, just for a moment, what it might be like to be a part of that circle. He wanted Pendennis\u2019s life, not so much for its material pleasures \u2013 the wine, the cigars, the clothes, the dinners \u2013 but for what it represented: the assurance that one would always be welcome in England.",
    "If he could only attain Pendennis\u2019s fluency, or at least an imitation of it, then he, too, would blend into the tapestry of this idyllic campus life. And he would no longer be the foreigner, second-guessing his pronunciation at every turn, but a native whose belonging could not possibly be questioned or revoked..",
    "\u2018I don\u2019t understand what anyone means by genteel,\u2019 said Ramy. \u2018People always throw it around in reference to the high- and well-born. But what\u2019s it actually mean? Does it just mean that you\u2019re very wealthy?\u2019",
    "The club on Bullingdon Green was an exclusive eating and sporting establishment where young men could while away the afternoon hunting or playing cricket. Membership was assigned on mysterious grounds that seemed to strongly correlate with wealth and influence. For all of Babel\u2019s prestige, none of the Babel students Robin knew had any expectations they might ever be invited.",
    "For some reason it was Letty who most ardently opposed Robin\u2019s accepting Pendennis\u2019s invitation. When they left the coffee shop for the library, long after the conversation had drifted elsewhere, she tugged at his elbow until they fell back several paces behind Ramy and Victoire.",
    "At ten to seven the following Friday, Robin put on his one nice jacket, pulled a bottle of port he\u2019d bought at Taylor\u2019s from under his bed, and walked to the flats on Merton Street. He had no trouble finding Elton Pendennis\u2019s rooms. Even before he\u2019d made his way down the street, he heard loud voices and somewhat arrhythmic piano music floating out of the windows.",
    "The boys were all crowded around Elton Pendennis like leaves around a bloom. Up close, the reports of his good looks seemed not to be exaggerated one bit. He was one of the handsomest men Robin had ever encountered, a Byronic hero incarnate. His hooded eyes were framed by thick, dark lashes; his plump lips would have looked girlish, as Letty had accused, if they weren\u2019t set off by such a strong, square jaw.",
    "\u2018It\u2019s not the company, it\u2019s the ennui,\u2019 he was saying. \u2018London\u2019s fun for a season, but then you start seeing all the same faces again year after year, and the girls don\u2019t ever get any prettier, just older. Once you\u2019ve been to one ball you might have been to them all. You know, one of my father\u2019s friends once promised his closest acquaintances that he could liven up their gatherings. He prepared an elaborate dinner party, then told his servants to go out and extend an invitation to all the beggars and homeless sops they came across.",
    "He pointed around the room with his cigar, wafting smoke about as he made introductions. \u2018That\u2019s Vincy Woolcombe.\u2019 A red-headed boy sitting next to Pendennis gave Robin a friendly wave. \u2018Milton St Cloud, who\u2019s been providing our musical entertainment.\u2019 The tow-haired, freckled St Cloud, who\u2019d taken his seat in front of the piano, nodded lazily, then resumed plunking out a tuneless sequence. \u2018And Colin Thornhill \u2013 you know him.\u2019",
    "\u2018Thirsty?\u2019 Pendennis asked. Assembled on the table was such a rich collection of liquor it made Robin dizzy to look at it. \u2018Help yourself to anything you want. We can never agree on the same drink. Port and sherry\u2019s being decanted over there \u2013 oh, I see you\u2019ve brought something, just put it on the table.\u2019 Pendennis did not even look at the bottle. \u2018Here\u2019s absinthe, there\u2019s the rum \u2013 oh, there\u2019s only a bit of gin left, but feel free to finish the bottle, it isn\u2019t very good. And we\u2019ve ordered a dessert from Sadler\u2019s, so please help yourself, otherwise it\u2019ll go bad sitting out like that.\u2019",
    "His cohort rarely drank together, out of deference to Ramy, and he had yet to acquire the detailed knowledge of types and makes of alcohol and what one\u2019s choice of drink said about one\u2019s character. But Professor Lovell always drank wine at dinner, so wine seemed safe.",
    "\u2018Don\u2019t listen to him,\u2019 said Woolcombe. \u2018He\u2019s going to live off his estate and subject all his guests to grand philosophical observations until he dies. I\u2019ll be a clergyman, Colin a solicitor. Milton\u2019s going to be a doctor, if he can find it in him to go to lectures.\u2019",
    "\u2018I write,\u2019 Pendennis said with very deliberate indifference, the way people who are very conceited throw out morsels of information they hope become objects of fascination. \u2018I write poetry. I haven\u2019t produced much so far\u2014\u2019",
    "\u2018All right.\u2019 Pendennis leaned forward, still feigning reluctance, and reached for a stack of papers that Robin realized had been set out for display on the coffee table this entire time. \u2018Now, this one is a reply to Shelley\u2019s \u201cOzymandias\u201d,* which is as you know an ode to the unforgiving ravaging of time against all great empires and their legacies. Only I\u2019ve argued that, in the modern era, legacies can be built to last and indeed there are great men of the sort at Oxford capable of such a monumental task.\u2019 He cleared his throat.",
    "\u2018Actually\u2014\u2019 Robin fidgeted with the stem of his glass for a moment, then decided to keep talking. \u2018I think translation can be much harder than original composition in many ways. The poet is free to say whatever he likes, you see \u2013 he can choose from any number of linguistic tricks in the language he\u2019s composing in. Word choice, word order, sound \u2013 they all matter, and without any one of them the whole thing falls apart.",
    "That\u2019s why Shelley writes that translating poetry is about as wise as casting a violet into a crucible.* So the translator needs to be translator, literary critic, and poet all at once \u2013 he must read the original well enough to understand all the machinery at play, to convey its meaning with as much accuracy as possible, then rearrange the translated meaning into an aesthetically pleasing structure in the target language that, by his judgment, matches the original. The poet runs untrammelled across the meadow. The translator dances in shackles.\u2019.",
    "His anxiety had dissipated entirely. He no longer felt concerned about how he presented, about whether his jacket was properly buttoned or he\u2019d left crumbs on the side of his mouth. He didn\u2019t want Pendennis\u2019s approval. He didn\u2019t care for any of these boys\u2019 approval at all.",
    "The truth of this encounter hit him with such clarity that he nearly laughed out loud. They were not appraising him for membership. They were trying to impress him \u2013 and by impressing him, to display their own superiority, to prove that to be a Babbler was not as good as being one of Elton Pendennis\u2019s friends.",
    "But Robin was not impressed. Was this the pinnacle of Oxford society? This? He felt a profuse pity for them \u2013 these boys who considered themselves aesthetes, who thought their lives were as rarefied as the examined life could be. But they would never engrave a word in a silver bar and feel the weight of its meaning reverberate in their fingers. They would never change the fabric of the world by simply wishing it.",
    "\u2018That and then some,\u2019 Robin said. He felt a heady rush every time he spoke. These boys were nothing; he could decimate them with a word if he so desired. He could jump up on the couch and hurl his wine against the curtains without consequence, because he simply did not care. This rush of heady confidence was wholly foreign to him, but it felt very good. \u2018Of course, the real point of Babel is silver-working. All that stuff about poetry is just the underlying theory.\u2019",
    "No one said anything as Robin retrieved his coat. Pendennis watched him lazily through lidded eyes, slowly sipping his Madeira. Colin was blinking very rapidly; his mouth opened once or twice, but nothing came out. Milton made a desultory gesture at getting up to walk him to the door, but Robin waved him back down.",
    "Letty did not respond. She picked up her books, dusted off her trousers, and stormed out of the Buttery. Victoire stood halfway up as if about to chase after her, then sighed, shook her head, and sat down.",
    "\u2018His name was Lincoln. Lincoln and Letty Price. They were so close when they were children that all their family\u2019s friends called them the twins. He came to Oxford some years before her, but he hadn\u2019t half the mind for books as she does, and every holiday he and their father would fight viciously over how he was squandering his education. He was much more like Pendennis than like any of us, if you know what I mean. One night he went out drinking. The police came to Letty\u2019s house the next morning, told them they\u2019d found Lincoln\u2019s body under a cart.",
    "\u2018She came up to Oxford a few months later,\u2019 said Victoire. \u2018Did you know Babel has a general entrance exam for applicants who don\u2019t come specially recommended? She took it and passed. It was the only faculty at Oxford that would take women. She\u2019d always wanted to come to Babel \u2013 she\u2019d studied for it her whole life \u2013 but her father kept refusing to let her go to school. It wasn\u2019t until Lincoln died that her father let her come and take his place. Bad to have a daughter at Oxford, but worse to have no children at Oxford at all. Isn\u2019t that terrible?\u2019",
    "\u2018I don\u2019t think you two quite understand how hard it is to be a woman here,\u2019 said Victoire. \u2018They\u2019re liberal on paper, certainly. But they think so very little of us. Our landlady roots through our things when we\u2019re out as if she\u2019s searching for evidence that we\u2019ve taken lovers. Every weakness we display is a testament to the worst theories about us, which is that we\u2019re fragile, we\u2019re hysterical, and we\u2019re too naturally weak-minded to handle the kind of work we\u2019re set to do.\u2019",
    "Victoire shot him a droll look. \u2018She\u2019s unbearable sometimes, yes. But she\u2019s not trying to be cruel. She\u2019s scared she isn\u2019t supposed to be here. She\u2019s scared everyone wishes she were her brother, and she\u2019s scared she\u2019ll be sent home if she steps even slightly out of line. Above all, she\u2019s scared that either of you might go down Lincoln\u2019s path. Go easy on her, you two. You don\u2019t know how much of her behaviour is dictated by fear.\u2019",
    "Letty\u2019s sulks never lasted long, and she soon expressed her tacit forgiveness. When they filed into Professor Playfair\u2019s office the next day, she returned Robin\u2019s tentative smile with her own. Victoire nodded when he glanced her way. They were all on the same page, it seemed; Letty knew that Robin and Ramy knew, she knew they were sorry, and she herself was sorry and more than a bit embarrassed for being so dramatic. There was nothing else to be said.",
    "\u2018Translators are always being accused of faithlessness,\u2019 boomed Professor Playfair. \u2018So what does that entail, this faithfulness? Fidelity to whom? The text? The audience? The author? Is fidelity separate from style? From beauty? Let us begin with what Dryden wrote about the Aeneid. I have endeavoured to make Virgil speak such English as he would himself have spoken, if he had been born in England, and in this present age.\u2019 He looked around the classroom. \u2018Does anyone here think that is fidelity?\u2019",
    "\u2018I\u2019ll bite,\u2019 said Ramy. \u2018No, I don\u2019t think that can possibly be right. Virgil belonged to a particular time and place. Isn\u2019t it more unfaithful to strip all that away, to make him speak like any Englishman you might run into on the street?\u2019",
    "Professor Playfair shrugged. \u2018Is it not also unfaithful to make Virgil sound like a stuffy foreigner, rather than a man you would happily carry on a conversation with? Or, as Guthrie did, to cast Cicero as a member of the English Parliament? But I confess, these methods are questionable. You take things too far, and you get something like Pope\u2019s translation of the Iliad.\u2019",
    "\u2018Perhaps in his original work,\u2019 said Professor Playfair. \u2018But he injects the text with so many Britishisms that he makes Homer sound like an eighteenth-century English aristocrat. Surely this does not accompany our image of the Greeks and Trojans at war.\u2019",
    "\u2018It isn\u2019t only the English that do this,\u2019 said Professor Playfair. \u2018Recall how Herder attacks the French neoclassicists for making Homer a captive, clad in French clothes, and following French customs, lest he offend. And all the well-known translators in Persia favoured the \u201cspirit\u201d of translation rather than word-for-word accuracy \u2013 indeed, they often found it appropriate to change European names into Persian and replace aphorisms in the target languages with Persian verse and proverbs. Was that wrong, do you think? Unfaithful?\u2019",
    "Professor Playfair ploughed on. \u2018There is no right answer, of course. None of the theorists before you have solved it either. This is the ongoing debate of our field. Schleiermacher argued that translations should be sufficiently unnatural that they clearly present themselves as foreign texts. He argued there were two options: either the translator leaves the author in peace and moves the reader towards him; or he leaves the reader in peace and moves the author towards him. Schleiermacher chose the former.",
    "\u2018But what is the opposite of fidelity?\u2019 asked Professor Playfair. He was approaching the end of this dialectic; now he needed only to draw it to a close with a punch. \u2018Betrayal. Translation means doing violence upon the original, means warping and distorting it for foreign, unintended eyes. So then where does that leave us? How can we conclude, except by acknowledging that an act of translation is then necessarily always an act of betrayal?\u2019",
    "Translators are of the same faithless and stolid race that they have ever been: the particle of gold they bring us over is hidden from all but the most patient eye, among shiploads of yellow sand and sulphur.",
    "Babel students did not take qualifying exams until the end of their third year, so Trinity flew by with no more and no less stress than the previous two terms. Somewhere in this flurry of papers, readings, and doomed late-night attempts to perfect Ramy\u2019s potato curry, their first year came to an end.",
    "It was customary for rising second years to go abroad during the summer for language immersion. Ramy spent June and July in Madrid learning Spanish and studying the Umayyad archives. Letty went to Frankfurt, where she apparently read nothing but incomprehensible German philosophy, and Victoire to Strasbourg, from which she returned with insufferable opinions on food and fine dining.* Robin had hoped he might have the chance to visit Japan that summer, but he was sent instead to the Anglo-Chinese College in Malacca to maintain his Mandarin.",
    "The college, which was run by Protestant missionaries, enforced an exhausting routine of prayers, readings in the classics, and courses in medicine, moral philosophy, and logic. Never did he get the chance to wander out of the compound onto Heeren Street, where the Chinese residents lived; instead, those weeks were an unbroken stream of sun, sand, and endless Bible study meetings among white Protestants..",
    "He was very glad when summer ended. They all returned to Oxford sun-darkened and at least a stone heavier each from eating better than they had all term. Still, none of them would have extended their breaks if they could have done. They\u2019d missed each other, they\u2019d missed Oxford with its rain and dreadful food, and they\u2019d missed the academic rigour of Babel. Their minds, enriched with new sounds and words, were like sleek muscles waiting to be stretched.",
    "This year, they were finally allowed access to the silver-working department. They would not be allowed to make their own engravings until year four, but this term they would begin a preparatory theory course called Etymology \u2013 taught, Robin learned with some trepidation, by Professor Lovell.",
    "\u2018Welcome back.\u2019 Normally he lectured in a plain suit, but today he\u2019d donned a black master\u2019s gown with tassels that swished dramatically around his ankles. \u2018The last time you were allowed on this floor, you saw the extent of the magic we create here. Today, we\u2019ll dismantle its mysteries. Have a seat.\u2019",
    "They sat in silence for a moment, not sure what to do. They\u2019d never seen Professor Playfair so upset. But just as abruptly, his features rearranged themselves back into his regular warmth and, with a slight hop, he began to lecture as if nothing had happened.",
    "\u2018The core principle underlying silver-working is untranslatability. When we say a word or phrase is untranslatable, we mean that it lacks a precise equivalent in another language. Even if its meaning can be partially captured in several words or sentences, something is still lost \u2013 something that falls into semantic gaps which are, of course, created by cultural differences in lived experience. Take the Chinese concept dao, which we translate sometimes as \u201cthe way\u201d, \u201cthe path\u201d, or \u201cthe way things ought to be\u201d.",
    "They nodded. This was nothing more than the thesis Professor Playfair had hammered into their heads all of last term \u2013 that all translation involved some degree of warp and distortion. Finally, it appeared, they were going to do something with this distortion.",
    "\u2018No translation can perfectly carry over the meaning of the original. But what is meaning? Does meaning refer to something that supersedes the words we use to describe our world? I think, intuitively, yes. Otherwise we would have no basis for critiquing a translation as accurate or inaccurate, not without some unspeakable sense of what it lacked.",
    "Humboldt,* for instance, argues that words are connected to the concepts they describe by something invisible, intangible \u2013 a mystical realm of meaning and ideas, emanating from a pure mental energy which only takes form when we ascribe it an imperfect signifier.\u2019.",
    "Professor Playfair tapped the desk in front of him, where a number of silver bars, both blank and engraved, had been arranged in a neat row. \u2018That pure realm of meaning \u2013 whatever it is, wherever it exists \u2013 is the core of our craft. The basic principles of silver-working are very simple. You inscribe a word or phrase in one language on one side, and a corresponding word or phrase in a different language on the other. Because translation can never be perfect, the necessary distortions \u2013 the meanings lost or warped in the journey \u2013 are caught, and then manifested by the silver.",
    "\u2018Of course.\u2019 Professor Playfair picked up the bar on the far right. \u2018We\u2019ve sold quite a few copies of this bar to fishermen. The Greek k\u00e1rabos has a number of different meanings including \u201cboat\u201d, \u201ccrab\u201d, or \u201cbeetle\u201d. Where do you think the associations come from?\u2019",
    "\u2018You\u2019re getting carried away, Mr Swift. But you\u2019re on the right path. Focus on k\u00e1rabos for now. From k\u00e1rabos we get caravel, which is a quick and lightweight ship. Both words mean \u201cship\u201d, but only k\u00e1rabos retains the sea-creature associations in the original Greek. Are you following?\u2019",
    "He tapped the ends of the bar, where the words k\u00e1rabos and caravel were written on opposite sides. \u2018Affix this to a fishing ship, and you\u2019ll find it yields a better load than any of its sister crafts. These bars were quite popular in the last century, until overuse meant fishing yields dropped down to what they were before. The bars can warp reality to some extent, but they can\u2019t materialize new fish. You\u2019d need a better word for that. Is this all starting to make sense?\u2019",
    "\u2018It is most often used to create a sugary home remedy that acts as an antidote to most types of poison. An ingenious discovery by a student named Evie Brooke \u2013 yes, that Evie \u2013 who realized the word treacle was first recorded in the seventeenth century in relation to the heavy use of sugar to disguise the bad taste of medicine. She then traced that back to the Old French triacle, meaning \u201cantidote\u201d or \u201ccure from snakebite\u201d, then the Latin theriaca, and finally to the Greek theriake, both meaning \u201cantidote\u201d.\u2019",
    "\u2018Daisy-chaining,\u2019 said Professor Playfair. He turned the bar around to show them the Latin and Greek engraved along the sides. \u2018It\u2019s a technique that invokes older etymologies as guides, shepherding meaning across miles and centuries. You might also think of it as extra stakes for a tent. It keeps the whole thing stable and helps us identify with accuracy the distortion we\u2019re trying to capture. But that\u2019s quite an advanced technique \u2013 don\u2019t worry about that for now.\u2019",
    "He lifted the third bar to the right. \u2018Here\u2019s something I came up with quite recently on commission for the Duke of Wellington.\u2019 He uttered this with evident pride. \u2018The Greek word idi\u00f3tes can mean a fool, as our idiot implies. But it also carries the definition of one who is private, unengaged with worldly affairs \u2013 his idiocy is derived not from lack of natural faculties, but from ignorance and lack of education. When we translate idi\u00f3tes to idiot, it has the effect of removing knowledge. This bar, then, can make you forget, quite abruptly, things you thought you\u2019d learned.",
    "Professor Playfair put the bar down. \u2018So there it is. It\u2019s all quite easy once you\u2019ve grasped the basic principle. We capture what is lost in translation \u2013 for there is always something lost in translation \u2013 and the bar manifests it into being. Simple enough?\u2019",
    "\u2018Not quite, Miss Price. We are restrained by the natural evolution of languages. Even words that diverge in meaning still have quite a close relationship with each other. This limits the magnitude of change the bars can effect. For example, you can\u2019t use them to bring back the dead, because we haven\u2019t found a good match-pair in a language where life and death are not in opposition to each other. Besides that, there\u2019s one other rather severe limitation to the bars \u2013 one that keeps every peasant in England from running around wielding them like talismans. Can anyone guess what it is?\u2019",
    "\u2018Quite right,\u2019 said Professor Playfair. \u2018Words have no meaning unless there is someone present who can understand them. And it can\u2019t be a shallow level of understanding \u2013 you can\u2019t simply tell a farmer what triacle means in French and expect that the bar will work. You need to be able to think in a language \u2013 to live and breathe it, not just recognize it as a smattering of letters on a page. This is also why invented languages* will never work, and why ancient languages like Old English have lost their effect.",
    "Old English would be a silver-worker\u2019s dream \u2013 we\u2019ve got such extensive dictionaries and we can trace the etymology quite clearly, so the bars would be wonderfully exact. But nobody thinks in Old English. Nobody lives and breathes in Old English. It\u2019s partly for this reason that the Classics education at Oxford is so rigorous. Fluency in Latin and Greek are still mandatory for many degrees, though the reformers have been agitating for years for us to drop those requirements. But if we ever did so, half the silver bars in Oxford would stop working.\u2019.",
    "\u2018That\u2019s why you\u2019re here,\u2019 Professor Playfair agreed. \u2018Psammetichus\u2019s boys. Wonderful, no, to hold such power by virtue of your foreign birth? I\u2019m quite good with new languages, yet it would take me years to invoke Urdu the way you can without hesitation.\u2019",
    "\u2018Very good question.\u2019 Professor Playfair held up the first and second bars. Placed side by side, the second bar was clearly slightly longer than the first. \u2018Now you\u2019ve raised the issue of endurance. Several things affect the endurance of a bar\u2019s effect. First is the concentration and amount of silver. Both these bars are over ninety per cent silver \u2013 the rest is a copper alloy, which is used often in coins \u2013 but the triacle bar is about twenty per cent larger, which means it\u2019ll last a few months longer, depending on frequency and intensity of use.\u2019",
    "He lowered the bars. \u2018Many of the cheaper bars you see around London don\u2019t last quite as long. Very few of them are actually silver all the way through. More often, they\u2019re just a thin sheen of silver coating over wood or some other cheap metal. They run out of charge in a matter of weeks, after which they need to be touched up, as we put it.\u2019",
    "This came out more sharply than he\u2019d intended. But he was thinking, then, of the choleric plague that had swept through London; of how Mrs Piper explained the poor simply could not be helped, for silver-work was so terribly costly.",
    "\u2018Oh, yes.\u2019 Professor Playfair seemed to find this all very funny. \u2018We hold the secrets, and we can set whatever terms we like. That\u2019s the beauty of being cleverer than everyone else. Now, one last thing before we conclude.\u2019 He plucked up one gleaming blank bar from the far end of the table. \u2018I must issue a warning. There is one match-pair that you must never, ever attempt. Can anyone guess what that is?\u2019",
    "\u2018The verb translate has slightly different connotations in each language. The English, Spanish, and French words \u2013 translate, traducir, and traduire \u2013 come from the Latin translat, which means \u201cto carry across\u201d. But we get something different once we move past Romance languages.\u2019 He began inscribing a new set of letters on the other side. \u2018The Chinese f\u0101ny\u00ec, for example, connotes turning or flipping something over, while the second character y\u00ec comes with a connotation of change and exchange. In Arabic, tarjama can refer both to biography and translation.",
    "In Sanskrit, the word for translation is anuvad, which also means \u201cto say or repeat after and again\u201d. The difference here is temporal, rather than the spatial metaphor of Latin. In Igbo, the two words for translation \u2013 tapia and kowa \u2013 both involve narration, deconstruction, and reconstruction, a breaking into pieces that makes possible a change in form. And so on. The differences and their implications are infinite. As such, there are no languages in which translation means exactly the same thing.\u2019.",
    "Amazed, they watched as the bar trembled with greater and greater violence. It was awful to witness. The bar seemed to have come alive, as if possessed by some spirit desperately trying to break free, or at least to split itself apart. It made no sound other than a fierce rattling against the table, but Robin heard in his mind a tortured, accompanying scream.",
    "\u2018The translation match-pair creates a paradox,\u2019 Professor Playfair said calmly as the bar started shaking so hard that it leapt inches off the table in its throes. \u2018It attempts to create a purer translation, something that will align to the metaphors associated with each word, but this is of course impossible, because no perfect translations are possible.\u2019",
    "The bar leapt high into the air and shattered into hundreds of tiny pieces that scattered across the tables, the chairs, the floor. Robin\u2019s cohort backed away, flinching. Professor Playfair did not bat an eye. \u2018Do not try it. Not even out of curiosity. This silver,\u2019 he kicked at one of the fallen shards, \u2018cannot be reused. Even if it\u2019s melted down and reforged, any bars made with even an ounce of it will be impotent. Even worse, the effect is contagious. You activate the bar when it\u2019s on a pile of silver, and it spreads to everything it\u2019s in contact with.",
    "\u2018Good. Never forget this. The ultimate viability of translation is a fascinating philosophical question \u2013 it is, after all, what lies at the heart of the story of Babel. But such theoretical questions are best left for the classroom. Not for experiments that might bring down the building.\u2019",
    "They sat around their regular table at the Buttery, feeling rather dizzy with power. They\u2019d been repeating the same sentiments about silver-working since class had been let out, but it didn\u2019t matter; it all felt so novel, so incredible. The whole world had seemed different when they stepped out of the tower. They\u2019d entered the wizard\u2019s house, had watched him mix his potions and cast his spells, and now nothing would satisfy them until they\u2019d tried it themselves.",
    "\u2018Close enough,\u2019 said Anthony. \u2018It involves a lot more thumbing through etymological dictionaries than tinkering per se, but once you\u2019ve seized upon something that might work, things get really fun. Right now I\u2019m playing with a pair I think might be useful in bakeries. Flour and flower.\u2019",
    "\u2018You would think,\u2019 said Anthony. \u2018But if you go back to the Anglo-French original of the thirteenth century, you\u2019ll find they were originally the same word \u2013 flower simply referred to the finest part of grain meal. Over time, flower and flour diverged to represent different objects. But if this bar works right, then I should be able to install it in milling machines to refine flour with more efficiency.\u2019 He sighed. \u2018I\u2019m not sure it will work. But I expect a lifetime of free scones from Vaults if it does.\u2019",
    "\u2018Oh, no. I get a modest sum, but all proceeding profits go to the tower. They do add my name to the ledger of match-pairs, though. I\u2019ve got six in there so far. And there are only about twelve hundred active match-pairs currently in use throughout the Empire, so that\u2019s about the highest academic laurel you can claim. Better than publishing a paper anywhere else.\u2019",
    "\u2018Well, think about it,\u2019 said Anthony. \u2018The problem should be obvious. Languages affect each other; they inject new meaning into each other, and like water rushing out of a dam, the more porous the barriers are, the weaker the force. Most of the silver bars that power London are translations from Latin, French, and German. But those bars are losing their efficacy. As linguistic flow spreads across continents \u2013 as words like saute and gratin become a standard part of the English lexicon \u2013 the semantic warp loses its potency.\u2019",
    "\u2018He\u2019s right,\u2019 said Anthony. \u2018So much has been translated from other European languages to English and vice versa in this century. We seem unable to kick our addiction to the Germans and their philosophers, or to the Italians and their poets. So, Romance Languages is really the most threatened branch of the faculty, as much as they\u2019d like to pretend they own the building. The Classics are getting less promising as well. Latin and Greek will hang on for a bit, since fluency in either is still the purview of the elites, but Latin, at least, is getting more colloquial than you\u2019d think.",
    "Somewhere on the eighth floor there\u2019s a postdoc working on a revival of Manx and Cornish, but no one thinks that\u2019s going to succeed. Same with Gaelic, but don\u2019t tell Cathy. That\u2019s why you three are so valuable.\u2019 Anthony pointed at them all in turn except for Letty. \u2018You know languages they haven\u2019t milked to exhaustion yet.\u2019.",
    "\u2018Well, you\u2019re all right for a bit, but only because Britain\u2019s developed its sense of national identity in opposition to the French. The French are superstitious heathens; we are Protestants. The French wear wooden shoes, so we wear leather. We\u2019ll resist French incursion on our language yet. But it\u2019s really the colonies and the semi-colonies \u2013 Robin and China, Ramy and India; boys, you\u2019re uncharted territory. You\u2019re the stuff that everyone\u2019s fighting over.\u2019",
    "\u2018Words tell stories.\u2019 This was how Professor Lovell opened their first class that afternoon, held in a spare, windowless room on the tower\u2019s fifth floor. \u2018Specifically, the history of those words \u2013 how they came into use, and how their meanings morphed into what they mean today \u2013 tell us just as much about a people, if not more, than any other kind of historical artefact. Take the word knave. Where do you think it comes from?\u2019",
    "Professor Lovell shook his head. \u2018The Old English cnafa refers to a boy servant, or young male servant. We confirm this with its German cognate Knabe, which is an old term for boy. So knaves were originally young boys who attended to knights. But when the institution of knighthood crumbled at the end of the sixteenth century, and when lords realized they could hire cheaper and better professional armies, hundreds of knaves found themselves unemployed.",
    "So they did what any young men down on their luck would do \u2013 they fell in with highwaymen and robbers and became the lowlife scoundrels that we label as knaves now. So the history of the word does not describe just a change in language, but a change in an entire social order.\u2019.",
    "Professor Lovell was not a passionate lecturer, nor a natural performer. He looked ill at ease before an audience; his movements were stilted and abrupt, and he spoke in a dry, sombre, straightforward manner. Still, every word out of his mouth was perfectly timed, well considered, and fascinating.",
    "In the days before this lecture, Robin had dreaded taking a class with his guardian. But it turned out not to be awkward or embarrassing. Professor Lovell treated him just like he had in front of company back in Hampstead \u2013 distant, formal, his eyes flitting always over Robin\u2019s face without landing, like the space where he existed could not be seen.",
    "\u2018We get the word etymology from the Greek \u00e9tymon,\u2019 continued Professor Lovell. \u2018The true sense of a word, from \u00e9tumos, the \u201ctrue or actual\u201d. So we can think of etymology as an exercise in tracing how far a word has strayed from its roots. For they travel marvellous distances, both literally and metaphorically.\u2019 He looked suddenly at Robin. \u2018What\u2019s the word for a great storm in Mandarin?\u2019",
    "\u2018We start with Greco-Latin,\u2019 said Professor Lovell. \u2018Typhon was a monster, one of the sons of Gaia and Tartarus, a devastating creature with a hundred serpentine heads. At some point he became associated with violent winds, because later the Arabs started using t\u016bf\u0101n to describe violent, windy storms. From Arabic it hopped over to Portuguese, which was brought to China on explorers\u2019 ships.\u2019",
    "\u2018And you don\u2019t think the Chinese could have come up with a transliteration that had its own meaning?\u2019 asked Professor Lovell. \u2018This happens all the time. Phonological calques are often semantic calques as well. Words spread. And you can trace contact points of human history from words that have uncannily similar pronunciations. Languages are only shifting sets of symbols \u2013 stable enough to make mutual discourse possible, but fluid enough to reflect changing social dynamics. When we invoke words in silver, we call to mind that changing history.\u2019",
    "\u2018Historical research is well and fine,\u2019 said Letty. \u2018All you have to do is look at artefacts, documents, and the like. But how do you research the history of words? How do you determine how far they\u2019ve travelled?\u2019",
    "Professor Lovell looked very pleased by this question. \u2018Reading,\u2019 he said. \u2018There is no other way around it. You compile all the sources you can get your hands on, and then you sit down to solve puzzles. You look for patterns and irregularities. We know, for instance, that the final Latin m was not pronounced in classical times, because inscriptions at Pompeii are misspelled in a way that leaves the m out. This is how we pin down sound changes.",
    "Once we do that, we can predict how words should have evolved, and if they don\u2019t match our predictions, then perhaps our hypothesis about linked origins is wrong. Etymology is detective work across centuries, and it\u2019s devilishly hard work, like finding a needle in a haystack. But our particular needles, I\u2019d say, are quite worth the search.\u2019.",
    "That year, using English as an example, they began the task of studying how languages grew, changed, morphed, multiplied, diverged, and converged. They studied sound changes; why the English knee had a silent k that was pronounced in the German counterpart; why the stop consonants of Latin, Greek, and Sanskrit had such a regular correspondence with consonants in Germanic languages. They read Bopp, Grimm, and Rask in translation; they read the Etymologiae of Isidorus.",
    "They studied semantic shifts, syntactical change, dialectical divergence, and borrowing, as well as the reconstructive methods one might use to piece together the relationships between languages that at first glance seemed to have nothing to do with each other. They dug through languages like they were mines, searching for valuable veins of common heritage and distorted meaning..",
    "It changed the way they spoke. Constantly they trailed off in the middle of sentences. They could not utter even common phrases and aphorisms without pausing to wonder where those words came from. Such interrogations infiltrated all their conversations, became the default way they made sense of each other and everything else.* They could no longer look at the world and not see stories, histories, layered everywhere like centuries\u2019 worth of sediment.",
    "And the influences on English were so much deeper and more diverse than they thought. Chit came from the Marathi chitti, meaning \u2018letter\u2019 or \u2018note\u2019. Coffee had made its way into English by way of Dutch (koffie), Turkish (kahveh), and originally Arabic (qahwah). Tabby cats were named after a striped silk that was in turn named for its place of origin: a quarter of Baghdad named al-\u2018Att\u0101biyya. Even basic words for clothes all came from somewhere.",
    "Damask came from cloth made in Damascus; gingham came from the Malay word genggang, meaning \u2018striped\u2019; calico referred to Calicut in Kerala, and taffeta, Ramy told them, had its roots in the Persian word tafte, meaning \u2018a shiny cloth\u2019. But not all English words had their roots in such far-flung or noble origins. The curious thing about etymology, they soon learned, was that anything could influence a language, from the consumption habits of the rich and worldly to the so-called vulgar utterances of the poor and wretched.",
    "English did not just borrow words from other languages; it was stuffed to the brim with foreign influences, a Frankenstein vernacular. And Robin found it incredible, how this country, whose citizens prided themselves so much on being better than the rest of the world, could not make it through an afternoon tea without borrowed goods.",
    "In addition to Etymology, they each took on an extra language that year. The point was not to attain fluency in this language, but to, through the process of its acquisition, deepen their understanding of their focus languages. Letty and Ramy began studying Proto-Indo-European with Professor De Vreese. Victoire proposed a number of West African languages she hoped to learn to the advisory board, but was rejected on the grounds that Babel possessed insufficient resources for proper instruction in any of them.",
    "Robin took Sanskrit with Professor Chakravarti, who began their first lesson by scolding Robin for having no knowledge of the language to begin with. \u2018They should teach Sanskrit to China scholars from the beginning. Sanskrit came to China by way of Buddhist texts, and this caused a veritable explosion of linguistic innovation, as Buddhism introduced dozens of concepts that Chinese had no easy word for. Nun, or bhiksun\u012b in Sanskrit, became ni.* Nirvana became ni\u00e8p\u00e1n.* Core Chinese concepts like hell, consciousness, and calamity come from Sanskrit.",
    "You can\u2019t begin to understand Chinese today without also understanding Buddhism, which means understanding Sanskrit. It\u2019s like trying to understand multiplication before you know how to draw numbers.\u2019.",
    "\u2018The alphabet,\u2019 Professor Chakravarti said cheerfully. \u2018Back to basic building blocks. Take out your pen and trace these letters until you\u2019ve developed a muscle memory for them \u2013 I expect it\u2019ll take you about half an hour. Go on.\u2019",
    "Latin, translation theory, etymology, focus languages, and a new research language \u2013 it was an absurdly heavy class load, especially when each professor assigned coursework as if none of the other courses existed. The faculty was utterly unsympathetic. \u2018The Germans have this lovely word, Sitzfleisch,\u2019 Professor Playfair said pleasantly when Ramy protested that they had over forty hours of reading a week. \u2018Translated literally, it means \u201csitting meat\u201d. Which all goes to say, sometimes you need simply to sit on your bottom and get things done.\u2019",
    "Still, they found their moments of joy. Oxford had now begun to feel like a home of sorts, and they carved their own pockets into it, spaces where they were not just tolerated but in which they thrived. They\u2019d learned which coffee houses would serve them without fuss, and which ones would either pretend Ramy did not exist or complain he was too dirty to sit on their chairs. They learned which pubs they could frequent after dark without harassment.",
    "They sat in the audience of the United Debating Society and gave themselves stitches trying to contain their laughter as boys like Colin Thornhill and Elton Pendennis shouted about justice, liberty, and equality until they were red in their faces..",
    "Robin took up rowing at Anthony\u2019s insistence. \u2018It\u2019s no good for you to stay cooped up in the library all the time,\u2019 he told him. \u2018One needs to stretch one\u2019s muscles for the brain to work properly. Get the blood flowing. Try it, it\u2019ll be good for you.\u2019",
    "As it happened, he adored it. He found great pleasure in the rhythmic straining motion of pulling a single oar against the water again and again. His arms grew stronger; his legs, somehow, felt longer. Gradually he lost his hunched-over reediness and acquired a filled-in look, which gave him deep satisfaction every morning when he glanced at the mirror. He started looking forward to chilly mornings on the Isis, when the rest of the town hadn\u2019t woken up yet, when the only sound he could hear for miles around was the birds chirping and the pleasant splash of blades sinking into the water.",
    "The girls tried, but failed, to sneak their way into the boat club. They weren\u2019t nearly tall enough to row, and coxing involved too much shouting for them to pretend they were men. But weeks later, Robin began hearing rumours of two vicious additions to the Univ fencing team, though Victoire and Letty at first claimed innocence upon interrogation.",
    "In the winter, the Isis froze over and they went skating, which none of them save Letty had ever done before. They laced their boots on as tight as they could go \u2013 \u2018Tighter,\u2019 said Letty, \u2018they can\u2019t wobble, else you\u2019ll break your ankles\u2019 \u2013 and staggered onto the ice, clutching each other for balance as they teetered forth, though usually this only meant that they all fell when one did.",
    "Then Ramy realized if he leaned forward and bent his knees, he could drive himself faster and faster, and by the third day he was skating circles around the rest, even Letty, who pretended to be upset when he skidded in her path but who couldn\u2019t stop laughing regardless..",
    "There was a solid, enduring quality to their friendship now. They were no longer dazzled and frightened first years, clinging to each other for stability. Instead they were weary veterans united by their trials, hardened soldiers who could lean against each other for anything. Meticulous Letty, despite her grumbling, would always mark up a translation, no matter how late at night or early in the morning. Victoire was like a vault; she would listen to any amount of complaining and petty griping without letting slip to the subjects thereof.",
    "When the new cohort \u2013 no girls, and four baby-faced boys \u2013 had appeared at Babel that autumn, they\u2019d given them scarcely any attention. They had, without consciously intending to, become just like the upperclassmen they had so envied during their first term. What they\u2019d perceived as snobbery and haughtiness, it turned out, was only exhaustion. Older students had no intention of bullying newer ones. They simply didn\u2019t have the time.",
    "They became what they\u2019d aspired to be since their first year \u2013 aloof, brilliant, and fatigued to the bone. They were miserable. They slept and ate too little, read too much, and fell completely out of touch with matters outside Oxford or Babel. They ignored the life of the world; they lived only the life of the mind. They adored it.",
    "And Robin, despite everything, hoped the day Griffin prophesied would never come, that he could live hanging in this balance forever. For he had never been happier than he was now: stretched thin, too preoccupied with the next thing before him to pay any attention to how it all fitted together.",
    "In late Michaelmas a French chemist named Louis-Jacques-Mand\u00e9 Daguerre came to Babel with a curious object in tow. It was a heliographic camera obscura, he announced, and could be capable of replicating still images using exposed copper plates and light-sensitive compounds, although he couldn\u2019t quite get the mechanics right. Could the Babblers take a look and see if they could improve it somehow?",
    "The problem of Daguerre\u2019s camera became the talk of the tower. The faculty made it a competition \u2013 any student cleared for silver-work who could solve Daguerre\u2019s problem was entitled to have their name on his patent, and a percentage of the riches that were sure to follow. For two weeks, the eighth floor frothed with silent frenzy as fourth years and graduate fellows flipped through etymological dictionaries, trying to find a set of words that would get at the right nexus of meaning involving light, colour, image, and imitation.",
    "It was Anthony Ribben who finally cracked it. As per contractual terms with Daguerre, the actual patented match-pair was kept a secret, but rumour was that Anthony had done something with the Latin imago, which in addition to meaning \u2018a likeness\u2019 or \u2018imitation\u2019 also implied a ghost or phantom. Other rumours held that Anthony had found some way to dissolve the silver bar to create fumes from heated mercury. Whatever it was, Anthony could not say, but he was paid handsomely for his efforts.",
    "The camera worked. Magically, the exact likeness of a captured subject could be replicated on a sheet of paper in marvellously little time. Daguerre\u2019s device \u2013 the daguerreotype, they called it \u2013 became a local sensation. Everyone wanted their picture taken. Daguerre and the Babel faculty put on a three-day exhibition in the tower lobby, and eager members of the public formed lines that wrapped around the street.",
    "They assembled themselves before the camera. Letty and Victoire sat down in chairs, hands folded stiffly in their laps. Robin and Ramy stood behind them, uncertain what to do with their hands. Should they place them on the girls\u2019 shoulders? On the chairs?",
    "\u2018It is not,\u2019 said Letty. She seemed bewitched as she observed the print, as if she\u2019d seen actual magic. \u2018It\u2019s us. Frozen in time, captured in a moment we\u2019ll never get back as long as we live. It\u2019s wonderful.\u2019",
    "Robin, too, thought the photograph looked strange, though he did not say so aloud. All of their expressions were artificial, masks of faint discomfort. The camera had distorted and flattened the spirit that bound them, and the invisible warmth and camaraderie between them appeared now like a stilted, forced closeness. Photography, he thought, was also a kind of translation, and they had all come out the poorer for it.",
    "To preserve the principles of their pupils they confine them to the safe and elegant imbecilities of classical learning. A genuine Oxford tutor would shudder to hear his young men disputing upon moral and political truth, forming and pulling down theories, and indulging in all the boldness of political discussion. He would augur nothing from it but impiety to God, and treason to Kings.",
    "Near the end of Michaelmas term that year, Griffin seemed to be around more than usual. Robin had been starting to wonder where he\u2019d gone; since he\u2019d got back from Malacca, his assignments had dropped from twice a month to once to none. But in December, Robin began to receive notes instructing him to meet Griffin outside the Twisted Root every few days, where they commenced their usual routine of walking frantically round the city. Usually these were preludes to planned thefts. But occasionally Griffin seemed to have no agenda in mind, and instead wanted only to chat.",
    "Robin eagerly awaited these talks; they were the only times when his brother seemed less mysterious, more human, more flesh and bone. But Griffin never answered the questions Robin really wanted to discuss, which were what Hermes did with the materials he helped steal, and how the revolution, if there was one, was proceeding. \u2018I still don\u2019t trust you,\u2019 he would say. \u2018You\u2019re still too new.\u2019.",
    "\u2018Just listen. Silver\u2019s been around forever. The Athenians were mining it in Attica, and the Romans, as you know, used silver to expand their empire once they realized what it could do. But silver didn\u2019t become international currency, didn\u2019t facilitate a trade network spanning continents, until much later. There simply wasn\u2019t enough of it. Then in the sixteenth century, the Hapsburgs \u2013 the first truly global empire \u2013 stumbled upon massive silver deposits in the Andes.",
    "The Spaniards brought it out of the mountains, courtesy of indigenous miners you can be certain weren\u2019t paid fairly for their labour,* and minted it into their little pieces of eight, which brought riches flowing into Seville and Madrid..",
    "\u2018Silver made them rich \u2013 rich enough to buy printed cotton cloth from India, which they used to pay for bound slaves from Africa, who they put to work on plantations in their colonies. So the Spanish become richer and richer, and everywhere they go they leave death, slavery, and impoverishment in their wake. You see the patterns so far, surely?\u2019",
    "Griffin, when lecturing, bore a peculiar resemblance to Professor Lovell. Both made very sharp gestures with their hands, as if punctuating their lengthy diatribes with hand movements instead of full stops, and both spoke in a very precise, syncopated manner. They also shared a fondness for Socratic questioning. \u2018Jump forward two hundred years, and what do you have?\u2019",
    "\u2018Right,\u2019 said Griffin. \u2018Silver accrues where it\u2019s already in use. The Spanish held the lead for a long time, while the Dutch, British, and French were nipping at their heels. Jump ahead another century, and Spain\u2019s a shadow of what it once was; the Napoleonic wars have eroded France\u2019s power, and now glorious Britannia is on top. Largest silver reserves in Europe. Best translation institute in the world by far. The best navy on the seas, cemented after Trafalgar, meaning this island is well on its way to ruling the world, isn\u2019t it? But something funny\u2019s been happening over the last century.",
    "\u2018China. This country is gorging itself on imports from the Orient. They can\u2019t get enough of China\u2019s porcelain, lacquered cabinets, and silks. And tea. Heavens. Do you know how much tea gets exported from China to England every year? At least thirty million pounds\u2019 worth. The British love tea so much that Parliament used to insist that the East India Company always keep a year\u2019s worth of supply in stock in case of shortages. We spend millions and millions on tea from China every year, and we pay for it in silver.",
    "\u2018But China has no reciprocal appetite for British goods. When the Qianlong Emperor received a display of British manufactured items from Lord Macartney, do you know what his response was? Strange and costly objects do not interest me. The Chinese don\u2019t need anything we\u2019re selling; they can produce everything they want on their own. So silver keeps flowing to China, and there\u2019s nothing the British can do about it because they can\u2019t alter supply and demand. One day it won\u2019t matter how much translation talent we have, because the silver reserves will simply not exist to put it to use.",
    "The British Empire will crumble as a consequence of its own greed. Meanwhile, silver will accrue in new centres of power \u2013 places that have heretofore had their resources stolen and exploited. They\u2019ll have the raw materials. All they\u2019ll need then are silver-workers, and the talent will go where the work is; it always does. So it\u2019s all as simple as running out the Empire. The cycles of history will do the rest, and you\u2019ve only got to help us speed it along.\u2019.",
    "\u2018But that\u2019s . . . \u2019 Robin trailed off, struggling to find the words to phrase his objection. \u2018That\u2019s so abstract, so simple, it can\u2019t possibly \u2013 I mean, certainly you can\u2019t predict history like this with such broad strokes\u2014\u2019",
    "\u2018There\u2019s quite a lot you can predict.\u2019 Griffin shot Robin a sideways look. \u2018But that\u2019s the problem with a Babel education, isn\u2019t it? They teach you languages and translation, but never history, never science, never international politics. They don\u2019t tell you about the armies that back dialects.\u2019",
    "\u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019 said Griffin. \u2018No one knows precisely what the future looks like. Whether the levers of power move to China, or to the Americas, or whether Britain\u2019s going to fight tooth and nail to hold on to its place \u2013 that\u2019s impossible to foretell.\u2019",
    "\u2018I can\u2019t predict how every encounter will shake out,\u2019 Griffin clarified. \u2018But I do know this. The wealth of Britain depends on coercive extraction. And as Britain grows, only two options remain: either her mechanisms of coercion become vastly more brutal, or she collapses. The former\u2019s more likely. But it might bring about the latter.\u2019",
    "\u2018Only if you think the Empire is inevitable,\u2019 said Griffin. \u2018But it\u2019s not. Take this current moment. We are just at the tail end of a great crisis in the Atlantic, after the monarchic empires have fallen one after the other. Britain and France lost in America, and then they went to war against each other to nobody\u2019s benefit. Now we\u2019re watching a new consolidation of power, that\u2019s true \u2013 Britain got Bengal, it got Dutch Java and the Cape Colony \u2013 and if it gets what it wants in China, if it can reverse this trade imbalance, it\u2019s going to be unstoppable.",
    "\u2018But nothing\u2019s written in stone \u2013 or even silver, as it were. So much rests on these contingencies, and it\u2019s at these tipping points where we can push and pull. Where individual choices, where even the smallest of resistance armies make a difference. Take Barbados, for example. Take Jamaica. We sent bars there to the revolts\u2014\u2019",
    "\u2018But slavery\u2019s been abolished, hasn\u2019t it?\u2019 said Griffin. \u2018At least in British territories. No \u2013 I\u2019m not saying everything\u2019s good and fixed, and I\u2019m not saying we can fully take the credit for British legislation; I\u2019m sure the abolitionists would take umbrage at that. But I am saying that if you think the 1833 Act passed because of the moral sensibilities of the British, you\u2019re wrong. They passed that bill because they couldn\u2019t keep absorbing the losses.\u2019",
    "He waved a hand, gesturing at an invisible map. \u2018It\u2019s junctures like that where we have control. If we push in the right spots \u2013 if we create losses where the Empire can\u2019t stand to suffer them \u2013 then we\u2019ve moved things to the breaking point. Then the future becomes fluid, and change is possible. History isn\u2019t a premade tapestry that we\u2019ve got to suffer, a closed world with no exit. We can form it. Make it. We just have to choose to make it.\u2019",
    "\u2018You really believe that,\u2019 said Robin, amazed. Griffin\u2019s faith astounded him. For Robin, such abstract reasoning was a reason to divest from the world, to retreat into the safety of dead languages and books. For Griffin, it was a rallying call.",
    "After that conversation, Griffin seemed to have decided Robin wasn\u2019t about to betray the Hermes Society, for Robin\u2019s assignments vastly increased in number. Not all of his missions involved theft. More often Griffin made requests for materials \u2013 etymological handbooks, Grammatica pages, orthography charts \u2013 which were easily acquired, copied out, and returned without drawing attention. Still, he had to be clever with when and how he took the books out, as he\u2019d attract suspicion if he kept sneaking away materials unrelated to his focus areas.",
    "One time Ilse, the upperclassman from Japan, demanded to know what he was doing with the Old German Grammatica, and he had to stammer out a story about pulling the title by accident in the course of trying to trace a Chinese word back to Hittite origins. No matter that he was at the entirely wrong section of the library. Ilse seemed ready to believe he was simply that dim..",
    "By and large, Griffin\u2019s requests were painless. It was all less romantic than Robin had imagined \u2013 and, perhaps, hoped for. There were no thrilling escapades or coded conversations spoken on bridges over running water. It was all so mundane. The great achievement of the Hermes Society, Robin learned, was how effectively it rendered itself invisible, how completely it concealed information even from its members. If one day Griffin disappeared, then Robin would be hard-pressed to prove to anyone the Hermes Society ever existed except as a figment of his imagination.",
    "Even the thefts became routine. Babel\u2019s professors seemed wholly unaware that anything was being stolen at all. The Hermes Society took silver only in amounts small enough to mask with some accounting trickery, for the virtue of a humanities faculty, Griffin explained, was that everyone was hopeless with numbers.",
    "Some days Griffin did not mention Hermes at all, but instead spent the hour it took to reach Port Meadow and back inquiring about Robin\u2019s life at Oxford \u2013 his rowing exploits, his favourite bookshops, his thoughts on the food in hall and in the Buttery.",
    "Robin answered cautiously. He kept waiting for the ball to drop, for Griffin to spin this conversation into an argument, for his own preference for plain scones to become the proof of his infatuation with the bourgeoisie. But Griffin only kept asking, and gradually it dawned on Robin that perhaps Griffin just missed being a student.",
    "The sun had set. The air had gone from pleasantly chilly to bone-cuttingly cold, but the city was bright with Christmas candles, and a light trickle of snow floated down around them. It was lovely. Robin slowed his pace, wanting to savour the scene, but Griffin, he noticed, was shivering madly.",
    "\u2018Bless your Mrs Piper,\u2019 Griffin said. \u2018The professor had some frigid crone named Mrs Peterhouse in my time. Couldn\u2019t cook to save her life, no, but always remembered to say something about half-breeds whenever I was in earshot. He didn\u2019t like that either, though; I suppose that\u2019s why he let her go.\u2019",
    "He\u2019d bought Robin the three-volume set of Oliver Twist. For a moment Robin could only stammer \u2013 he hadn\u2019t known they were exchanging gifts, he hadn\u2019t bought anything for Griffin \u2013 but Griffin waved this off. \u2018That\u2019s all right, I\u2019m older than you, don\u2019t embarrass me.\u2019",
    "But that was impossible. Robin\u2019s life was split into two, and Griffin existed in the shadow world, hidden from sight. Robin could never bring him back to Magpie Lane. Could never introduce him to his friends. Could never, in daylight, call him brother.",
    "On the first day of Hilary term, the main entrance to Babel was blocked off by four armed policemen. They appeared to be engaged with someone or something inside, though whatever it was, Robin could not see over the crowd of shivering scholars.",
    "A fifth and sixth policeman emerged from the building, dragging the man Robin assumed was the thief between them. He was middle-aged, dark-haired, bearded, and dressed in very grimy clothes. Not Hermes, then, Robin thought with some relief. The thief\u2019s face was contorted in pain, and his moans floated over the crowd as the police pulled him down the steps towards a waiting cab. They left a streak of blood on the cobblestones behind them.",
    "\u2018The tower\u2019s protected by the most sophisticated security system in the country,\u2019 said Anthony. \u2018It\u2019s not just the Grammaticas that are guarded. There\u2019s about half a million pounds\u2019 worth of silver in this building, and only spindly academics around to defend it. Of course the doors are warded.\u2019",
    "\u2018They never tell us the match-pairs; they\u2019re very private about it. Playfair updates them every few months, which is about as often as someone attempts a theft. I must say, I like this set much better \u2013 the last set tore gaping wounds in the trespasser\u2019s limbs using ancient knives rumoured to be from Alexandria. It got blood all over the inside carpet; you can still see the brown spots if you look carefully. We spent weeks guessing which words Playfair used, but no one\u2019s been able to crack it.\u2019",
    "\u2018The bars aren\u2019t that sophisticated,\u2019 Griffin said dismissively. \u2018They\u2019re designed to discriminate between students, their guests, and strangers to the Institute. What do you think would happen if the traps sprang on a translator who needed to take some bars home overnight? Or someone bringing his wife to the faculty without first clearing it with Playfair? You\u2019re completely safe.\u2019",
    "\u2018But how do you know?\u2019 Robin sounded more petulant than he\u2019d intended. He cleared his throat, tried to deepen his voice without being obvious about it. \u2018You didn\u2019t see what I saw, you don\u2019t know what the new match-pairs are\u2014\u2019",
    "\u2018You\u2019re in no danger. Here \u2013 take this, if you\u2019re worried.\u2019 Griffin rummaged in his pocket, then tossed Robin a bar. W\u00fax\u00edng, it read. Invisible. It was the same bar he\u2019d used the first night they met.",
    "He\u2019d strayed into dangerous territory. He knew, from the way Griffin\u2019s eyes flashed, he\u2019d wandered too close to where it hurt. A month ago, when their relationship was more precarious, he might have changed the subject. But he couldn\u2019t hold his silence now. He felt irritated and belittled just then, and with that came a hot desire to hurt.",
    "\u2018Because I don\u2019t dream in Chinese.\u2019 His expression did not change, nor did his tone, but the condescending fury seeped through his words nonetheless. Watching him speak then was uncanny. He looked so like their father. \u2018I\u2019m your failed predecessor, you see. Dear old Papa took me out of the country too early. I\u2019ve got a natural ear for tones, but that\u2019s it. My fluency is largely artificial. I don\u2019t have memories in Chinese. I don\u2019t dream in it. I\u2019ve got the recall, I\u2019ve got the language skills, but I can\u2019t reliably make the bars work. Half the time they do nothing at all.\u2019 His throat pulsed.",
    "\u2018Our father got it right with you. He left you to ferment until you were literate. But he brought me here before I\u2019d formed enough connections, enough memories. What\u2019s more, he was the only person I ever spoke Mandarin with, when my Cantonese was far better to begin with. And that\u2019s lost now. I don\u2019t think in it, and I certainly don\u2019t dream in it.\u2019.",
    "Robin could see Oxford now through Griffin\u2019s eyes \u2013 an institution that never valued him, that had only ever ostracized and belittled him. He imagined Griffin coming up through Babel, trying desperately to win Professor Lovell\u2019s approval, but never able to get the silver to work consistently. How awful it would have felt to reach for flimsy Chinese from a barely remembered life, knowing full well that it was the only thing that gave him value here.",
    "He checked the back of the note for other details as he walked, but Griffin had included no further instructions. This wasn\u2019t necessarily a problem \u2013 Robin assumed this meant he should simply let whatever accomplices showed up in and out of the tower \u2013 but the hour was surprisingly early, and he realized belatedly that he hadn\u2019t brought anything with him \u2013 no books, no satchel, not even an umbrella \u2013 that would justify a late-night trip to the tower.",
    "But he couldn\u2019t fail to show at all. As the bells struck eleven, he dashed across the green and yanked the door open. This was nothing he hadn\u2019t done a dozen times before \u2013 open sesame, close sesame, and stay out of the way. As long as Robin\u2019s blood was stored in those stone walls, the wards shouldn\u2019t sound.",
    "Two Hermes operatives followed him through and disappeared up the stairs. Robin hung around the foyer as usual, keeping an eye out for nocturnal scholars, counting down the seconds until it was time to leave. At five past eleven, the Hermes operatives hurried downstairs. One of them carried a set of engraving tools, the other a chest of silver bars.",
    "Robin nodded and opened the door to let them out. The moment they stepped foot over the barrier, an awful cacophony split the air \u2013 a screaming, a howling, the grinding of metal gears in some invisible mechanism. It was a threat and a warning, the hybrid of ancient horror and the modern capacity for spilling blood. Behind them, the panels in the door shifted, revealing a dark cavity within.",
    "Robin hesitated, trying to decide whether to follow. He might get away \u2013 the trap was loud, but seemed slow-acting. He glanced down and saw both his feet were planted squarely on the university\u2019s coat of arms. Suppose the ward was only triggered if he stepped off?",
    "One way to find out. He took a deep breath, then dashed down the stairs. He heard a bang, then felt a searing pain in his left arm. He couldn\u2019t tell where he\u2019d been hit. The pain seemed to come from everywhere, less a singular wound and more a burning agony that spread through his entire arm. It was on fire, it was exploding, the whole limb was going to fall off. He kept running. Bullets fired into the air behind him. He ducked and jumped at random; he\u2019d read somewhere this was how to dodge gunshots, but had no idea if it was true.",
    "Then the pain and fear caught up with him. His knees shook. He took two more steps and collapsed against the wall, fighting the urge to vomit. His head swam. He couldn\u2019t outrun the police if they came. Not like this, not with blood dripping down his arm and black creeping at the edges of his vision. Focus. He fumbled for the bar in his pocket. His left hand was slippery, dark with blood; the very sight set off another wave of vertigo.",
    "It was Professor Playfair. Robin flinched, prepared for the worst, but the professor\u2019s face creased into a warm, concerned smile. \u2018Oh, hello, Swift. Didn\u2019t realize that was you. Are you quite all right? There\u2019s a ruckus on at the building.\u2019",
    "\u2018Did you see anyone?\u2019 asked Professor Playfair. \u2018The wards are meant to shoot the intruder, you know, but the gears seem to have stuck after last time. Might have still hit him, though \u2013 did you see anyone with a limp, anyone who looked like they were in pain?\u2019",
    "\u2018No, I didn\u2019t \u2013 I was almost to the green when the alarms went off, but I hadn\u2019t turned the corner.\u2019 Was Professor Playfair nodding in sympathy? Robin hardly dared believe his luck. \u2018Is it \u2013 was there a thief?\u2019",
    "\u2018Perhaps not. Don\u2019t you worry.\u2019 Professor Playfair reached out and patted him on the shoulder. The impact sent another horrible wave of pain through his whole upper body, and Robin clenched his teeth to keep from crying out. \u2018The wards get finicky sometimes \u2013 perhaps it\u2019s time to replace them. Pity, I liked this version. Are you all right?\u2019",
    "\u2018Ah, right. Awful, wasn\u2019t it? Nice to know that my little idea worked, though. They wouldn\u2019t even let me test it out on dogs beforehand. Good thing it wasn\u2019t you it malfunctioned on.\u2019 Professor Playfair barked out a laugh. \u2018Might have pumped you full of lead.\u2019",
    "Robin had this lie ready. \u2018I was feeling anxious, so I thought I\u2019d get a head start on a paper for Professor Lovell. But I\u2019m a bit shaken up, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll do any good work if I start now, so I think I\u2019d rather just head to bed.\u2019",
    "\u2018Of course.\u2019 Professor Playfair patted his shoulder again. It felt more forceful this time; Robin\u2019s eyes bulged. \u2018Richard would say you\u2019re being lazy, but I quite understand. You\u2019re still only in your second year, you can afford to be lazy. Go home and sleep.\u2019",
    "Professor Playfair gave him a last cheerful nod and strolled off towards the tower, where the alarms were still wailing. Robin took a deep breath and hobbled away, striving with all his might not to collapse on the street.",
    "Somehow he made it back to Magpie Lane. The bleeding still had not stopped, but after wiping his arm with a wet towel, he saw to his relief that the bullet had not lodged in his arm. It had only grazed a notch into the flesh above his elbow, about a third of an inch deep. The wound looked reassuringly small when he wiped the blood away. He didn\u2019t know how to dress it properly \u2013 he imagined it might involve a needle and thread \u2013 but it would be foolish to go and seek the college nurse at this hour.",
    "He gritted his teeth against the pain, trying to remember what useful advice he\u2019d picked up from adventure novels. Alcohol \u2013 he needed to disinfect the wound. He rummaged around his shelves until he found a half-empty bottle of brandy, a Christmas gift from Victoire. He dribbled it over his arm, hissing from the sting, then swallowed down several mouthfuls for good measure. Next he found a clean shirt, which he ripped up to make bandages. These he wrapped tightly around his arm using his teeth \u2013 he\u2019d read that pressure helped stanch the bleeding. He didn\u2019t know what else he ought to do.",
    "He sat against the wall, head tilted towards the roof, and took several deep breaths. He just had to get through this night. It took several shirts \u2013 he\u2019d have to go to the tailor, make up some story about a laundry disaster \u2013 but eventually, the bleeding was stemmed. At last, exhausted, he slumped over and fell asleep.",
    "The next day, after wincing through three hours of class, Robin went to the medical library and rooted through the stacks until he found a physician\u2019s handbook on field wounds. Then he went to Cornmarket, bought a needle and thread, and hurried home to suture his arm back together.",
    "He couldn\u2019t do it. He kept bringing the needle close to the wound and then, anticipating the pain, pulling it away. He reached for the brandy and took three massive gulps. He waited several minutes until the alcohol had settled nicely in his stomach and his extremities had begun tingling pleasantly. This was where he needed to be \u2013 dull enough not to mind the pain, alert enough to sew himself together. He tried again. It was easier this time, though he still had to stop to jam a wadded cloth in his mouth to keep from yelling. At last he made the final stitch.",
    "His forehead dripped with sweat; tears flowed freely down his cheeks. Somehow, he found the strength to snip the thread, tie the sutures off with his teeth, and toss the bloody needle into the sink. Then he collapsed back on his bed and, curling onto his side, finished the rest of the bottle..",
    "Robin knew it was foolish to expect he would be. Griffin, upon learning what had happened, would likely have gone underground, and for good reason. Robin wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he didn\u2019t hear from Griffin for an entire term. Still, he felt an overwhelming, black wave of resentment.",
    "He wanted their next meeting to happen sooner just so he could yell at him, say he\u2019d told him so, that Griffin should have listened. That if Griffin weren\u2019t so arrogant, perhaps his little brother wouldn\u2019t have a line of messy stitches up his arm. But the appointment didn\u2019t come. Griffin left no notes in his window the next night, or the night after. He seemed to have disappeared without a trace from Oxford, leaving Robin with no way of contacting him or Hermes at all.",
    "He couldn\u2019t talk to Griffin. Couldn\u2019t confide in Victoire, Letty, or Ramy. He had only himself for company that night, crying miserably over the empty bottle while his arm throbbed. And for the first time since he\u2019d arrived at Oxford, Robin felt truly alone.",
    "Robin saw none of Griffin for the rest of Hilary Term, or Trinity. In truth, he hardly noticed; his second-year coursework only got more difficult as the weeks went on, and he barely had time to dwell on his resentment.",
    "Summer came, though it was not a summer at all but rather an accelerated term, and his days were occupied with frantically cramming Sanskrit vocabulary for an assessment the week before next Michaelmas began. Then they were third-year students, a status that entailed all the exhaustion of Babel with none of its novelties. Oxford lost its charm that September; the golden sunsets and bright blue skies replaced by an endless chill and fog. It rained an inordinate amount, and the storm winds felt uniquely vicious compared to previous years. Their umbrellas kept breaking.",
    "That was just as well. None of them had time for sports anymore. The third year at Babel was traditionally known as the Siberian winter, and the reason became obvious when they were issued their courses lists. They were all continuing in their tertiary languages and in Latin, which was rumoured to become devilishly difficult when Tacitus entered the picture. They were also continuing in Translation Theory with Professor Playfair and Etymology with Professor Lovell, though the workload for each course had now doubled, as they were expected to produce a five-page paper for each class every week.",
    "Most importantly, they were all assigned supervisors with whom they would pursue an independent research project. This counted as their proto-dissertation \u2013 their first piece of work that would, if completed successfully, be preserved on Babel\u2019s shelves as a true piece of scholarly contribution.",
    "Ramy and Victoire were both immediately unhappy with their supervisors. Ramy had been invited by Professor Joseph Harding to contribute to an editorial round of the Persian Grammatica, which was nominally a great honour.* But Ramy couldn\u2019t see the romance in such a project.",
    "\u2018Initially I proposed a translation of Ibn Khaldun\u2019s manuscripts,\u2019 he told them. \u2018The ones Silvestre de Sacy\u2019s got hold of. But Harding objected that the French Orientalists were already working on that, and that it was unlikely I could get Paris to lend them to me for the term.",
    "So then I asked if I might just translate Omar ibn Said\u2019s Arabic essays into English, given that they\u2019ve just been sitting around for a near decade in our collections, but Harding said that was unnecessary because abolition had already passed into law in England, can you believe it?* As if America doesn\u2019t exist? At last Harding said if I wanted to do something authoritative, then I could edit the citations in the Persian Grammatica, so he\u2019s got me reading Schlegel now. \u00dcber die Sprache und Weisheit der Indier. And you know what? Schlegel wasn\u2019t even in India when he wrote that.",
    "Yet Ramy\u2019s indignation seemed trivial compared to what Victoire was dealing with. She was working with Professor Hugo Leblanc, with whom she\u2019d studied French for two years with no trouble, but who now became a source of ceaseless frustration.",
    "\u2018Not even remotely,\u2019 said Victoire. \u2018French is the lexifier, yes, but Krey\u00f2l is its own language, with its own grammatical rules. French and Krey\u00f2l are not mutually intelligible. You could have studied French for a decade, but a Krey\u00f2l poem might still be impossible to decipher without a dictionary. Leblanc doesn\u2019t have a dictionary \u2013 there is no dictionary, not yet \u2013 so I\u2019m the next best thing.\u2019",
    "\u2018Perhaps not,\u2019 said Victoire. \u2018I haven\u2019t \u2013 I mean, I don\u2019t know. But they\u2019re not meant to be shared. Would you be content to sit hour after hour with a white man as he asks you the story behind every metaphor, every god\u2019s name, so he can pilfer through your people\u2019s beliefs for a match-pair that might make a silver bar glow?\u2019",
    "This was the worst reply she could have made. Victoire clamped her mouth shut and looked away. The conversation died. An awkward silence descended, which neither Victoire nor Letty made any attempt to break. Robin and Ramy exchanged a glance, clueless, foolish. Something had gone terribly wrong, a taboo had been breached, but they were all too afraid to probe at precisely what.",
    "Robin and Letty were passably happy with their projects, plodding and time-consuming as they were. Robin was working with Professor Chakravarti to complete a list of Sanskrit loanwords to Chinese, and Letty was working with Professor Leblanc to wade through French scientific papers for possibly useful and untranslatable metaphors in the realm of mathematics and engineering. They learned to avoid discussing the details around Ramy and Victoire. They all used platitudes with each other; Robin and Letty were always \u2018making good progress\u2019 while Ramy and Victoire were \u2018struggling on as usual\u2019.",
    "Privately, Letty was not so generous. The subject of Professor Leblanc had become a sticking point between her and Victoire, who was hurt and astounded by Letty\u2019s lack of sympathy, while Letty thought Victoire was being too sensitive about it all.",
    "\u2018She\u2019s brought this on herself,\u2019 she complained to Robin. \u2018She could make this so much easier if she\u2019d just do the research \u2013 I mean, no one\u2019s done a third-year project in Haitian Creole, there\u2019s barely even a Grammatica. She could be the very first!\u2019",
    "Halfway into Michaelmas, Letty and Victoire were hardly talking to each other. They always came to class several minutes apart, and Robin wondered if it took skill to space out their departures so that they never crossed paths on the long walk down.",
    "The girls were not the only ones suffering fractures. The atmosphere of those days was oppressive. Something had seemed to break between them all \u2013 no, break was perhaps too strong a word, for they still clung to each other with the force of people who had no one else. But their bond had twisted in a decidedly hurtful direction. They still spent nearly all their waking moments together, but they dreaded each other\u2019s company.",
    "Everything was an unintended slight or deliberate offence \u2013 if Robin complained about Sanskrit, it was insensitive to the fact that Professor Harding kept insisting Sanskrit was one of Ramy\u2019s languages when it wasn\u2019t; if Ramy was pleased he and Professor Harding had finally agreed on a research direction, it was a callous remark to Victoire, who had got nowhere with Professor Leblanc. They used to find solace in their solidarity, but now they saw each other only as reminders of their own misery..",
    "The worst, from Robin\u2019s perspective, was that something had changed suddenly and mysteriously between Letty and Ramy. Their interactions were as heated as ever \u2013 Ramy never ceased to make fun, and Letty never ceased to flare up in response. But now Letty\u2019s rejoinders had acquired an oddly victimized tone. She snapped at the smallest, often intangible slights. Ramy in return had got more cruel and more snide in a way that was hard to describe.",
    "But things were decidedly not all right. Things were in fact very weird. Ramy and Letty seemed unable to stand each other, and at the same time, they gravitated around each other; they could not speak normally without fiercely opposing each other in a way that made them the protagonists of the conversation. If Ramy wanted coffee, Letty wanted tea; if Ramy thought that a painting on the wall was pretty, then Letty suddenly had twelve reasons why it exemplified the worst of the Royal Academy\u2019s adherence to artistic conventionalism.",
    "Robin found it unbearable. One night, during a fitful burst of sleep, he had a sudden and violent fantasy of pushing Letty into the Cherwell. When he awoke he searched himself for any hint of guilt, but could find none; the thought of Letty drenched and sputtering brought just as much vicious satisfaction in the sober light of day.",
    "There was at least the distraction of their third-year apprenticeships, for which they would each assist a faculty member in their silver-working duties throughout the term. \u2018Theory comes from the Greek the\u014dria, meaning a sight or spectacle, whose root also gives us the word theatre.\u2019 So Professor Playfair expounded before he sent them off with their respective supervisors. \u2018But it is not enough to merely watch the operations. You must get your hands dirty. You must understand how the metal sings.\u2019",
    "In practice this meant a lot of unpaid donkey work. To Robin\u2019s disappointment, the apprentices spent very little time on the eighth floor, where all the exciting research happened. Instead, three times a week, he accompanied Professor Chakravarti on trips around Oxford, helping with silver-work installation and upkeep.",
    "He learned how to polish silver until it shone (oxidation and tarnishing greatly dampened the match-pair effect), how to choose between different sizes of engraving styluses to painstakingly restore an inscription to its original clarity, and how to deftly slide the bars in and out of their specially welded fixtures. It was too bad that Griffin had gone underground, he thought, for his apprenticeship gave him almost unrestricted access to the tower\u2019s tools and raw materials. He wouldn\u2019t have had to let thieves in at midnight.",
    "\u2018Oh, it never ends,\u2019 said Professor Chakravarti. \u2018It\u2019s how we make all our money, you see. The bars fetch a high price, but it\u2019s the upkeep that\u2019s the real grift. The workload is a bit harder on myself and Richard, though, since there are so few Sinologists.\u2019",
    "That afternoon they were doing a house call on an estate in Wolvercote, where a silver-work installation in the back garden had ceased to function despite a twelve-month warranty. They\u2019d had some trouble getting through the front gate \u2013 the housekeeper seemed unconvinced they were Babel scholars, and rather suspicious that they were here to rob the place \u2013 but after supplying various proofs of identification, including the recitations of many Latin graces, they were at last invited in.",
    "The housekeeper led them through the estate to a very lush, pretty garden with a burbling, serpentine stream and several large rocks arranged at random. It was designed in the Chinese style, they were informed, which had become very popular in that era after William Chambers\u2019s Oriental landscaping designs were shown for the first time in Kew Gardens. Robin could not recall ever seeing anything like this in Canton, but he nodded along appreciatively until the housekeeper had gone.",
    "\u2018Well, the problem here\u2019s obvious.\u2019 Professor Chakravarti pushed some shrubbery aside to reveal the fence corner where the silver-work was installed. \u2018They\u2019ve been pushing a cart back and forth over the bar. It\u2019s rubbed the engraving half off. That\u2019s their own fault \u2013 this won\u2019t qualify under the warranty.\u2019",
    "He let Robin extract it from its fixture, then turned the bar around to show him the inscription. On one side: garden; on the other, the character \u9f4b, which could mean a landscape garden, but more generally evoked a place for private withdrawal, to retreat from the world, with connotations of ritual purification, cleansing, alms-giving, and Daoist acts of repentance.",
    "\u2018The idea is to make their gardens nicer and quieter than the hubbub of Oxford allows. Keeps out the riffraff. The effect is quite subtle, if we\u2019re being honest; we didn\u2019t do all that much testing, but there\u2019s really no limit to what the wealthy will throw money at.\u2019 Professor Chakravarti whittled at the bar as he spoke. \u2018Hm. We\u2019ll see if that\u2019ll do the trick.\u2019",
    "\u2018I just \u2013 what, say the words?\u2019 Robin had seen the professors do the same many times, though he couldn\u2019t imagine it was all that easy. Then again, he recalled, the w\u00fax\u00edng bar had worked for him on the first try.",
    "\u2018Well, it\u2019s a particular kind of mental state. You do speak the words, but more importantly, you hold two meanings in your head at once. You exist in both linguistic worlds simultaneously, and you imagine traversing them. Does that make sense?\u2019",
    "\u2018Oh, no, I\u2019m being careless. There are some good mental heuristics you\u2019ll learn during your fourth year, and some theory seminars you\u2019ll have to sit through, but when it comes down to it, it\u2019s about the feeling.\u2019 Professor Chakravarti seemed rather bored; Robin got the impression he was still very irritated by this household and wanted to be away as quickly as possible. \u2018Go on.\u2019",
    "\u2018Well, that depends on a number of things,\u2019 said Professor Chakravarti. \u2018To begin with, the nature of the impact. With some bars, you want a temporary manifestation. Suppose you need a short and extreme physical effect \u2013 a lot of military bars work this way. Then they need to be activated each time upon use, and they\u2019re designed so that the effects don\u2019t last long. But other bars have an enduring effect \u2013 like the wards in the tower, for example, or the bars installed in ships and carriages.\u2019",
    "\u2018The number of carats, to start with. Finer silver endures, and the higher the percentage of other alloys, the shorter the time of effect. But there are also subtle differences in the way they\u2019re smelted and engraved; you\u2019ll learn soon enough.\u2019 Professor Chakravarti shot him a smile. \u2018You\u2019re eager to get started, aren\u2019t you?\u2019",
    "One afternoon, they arrived at the Ashmolean Museum to fix a silver bar that no number of incantations would activate. The English side read verify, and the Chinese side used the character \u53c3, meaning \u2018to validate\u2019. It could also mean \u2018to juxtapose\u2019, \u2018to arrange side by side\u2019, and \u2018to compare things\u2019. The Ashmolean staff had been using this to compare fraudulent artifacts against the real ones, but recently it had failed several test runs, which the staff wisely conducted before appraising new acquisitions.",
    "They carefully inspected the bar under a hand-held microscope, but neither the Chinese nor the English calligraphy showed any sign of erosion. Even after Professor Chakravarti went over the whole thing with his smallest engraving stylus, it still failed to activate.",
    "Back at Babel, Professor Chakravarti led Robin up to the southern wing of the eighth floor, past the worktables. Robin had never been in this area before. All of his visits to the eighth floor had been restricted to the workshop, which occupied most of what the eye saw past the thick fire door. But another set of doors blocked off the southern wing, bolted shut with three sets of locks, which Professor Chakravarti now opened with a jangling ring of keys.",
    "It was like entering a fun house exhibit, or the inside of a giant piano. Massive silver rods of varying heights and lengths stood upright all across the floor. Some were waist high; others towered above him, stretching from the floor to the ceiling, with just enough room between them for one to step nimbly through without touching any. They reminded Robin rather of church organs; he had a strange impulse to take a mallet and strike them all at once.",
    "\u2018Resonance is a way of cutting costs,\u2019 Professor Chakravarti explained. \u2018We need to save the higher-carat silver for bars with endurance needs \u2013 the bars that go into the Navy, that protect merchant ships, and the like. So we use silver with a higher percentage of alloys for the bars that operate on English land, since we can keep them fuelled with resonance.\u2019",
    "\u2018It\u2019s easiest to think of Babel as the centre, and all the resonance-dependent bars in England as the periphery. The periphery draws on the centre for power.\u2019 Professor Chakravarti gestured around him. Each rod, Robin noticed, appeared to be vibrating at a very high frequency, but though it felt as if the tower should be ringing with discordant notes, the air was still and silent. \u2018These rods, engraved with commonly used match-pairs, sustain linked bars throughout the country.",
    "\u2018So do these resonate with every bar in England?\u2019 Robin saw in his mind an invisible network of meaning stretching over the country, keeping the silver-work alive. It was quite terrifying to consider. \u2018I\u2019d have thought there would be more of them.\u2019",
    "\u2018Not quite. There are much smaller resonance centres across the country \u2013 there\u2019s one in Edinburgh, for example, and one in Cambridge. The effect does weaken with distance. But the lion\u2019s share is in Oxford \u2013 it spreads the Translation Institute too far out to maintain multiple centres, as you need trained translators for the upkeep.\u2019",
    "Robin bent to examine one of the closest rods. In addition to the match-pair, written in large calligraphy at the top, he saw a series of letters and symbols that he could make no sense of. \u2018How\u2019s the link forged, then?\u2019",
    "\u2018It\u2019s a complicated process.\u2019 Professor Chakravarti led Robin to a slender rod near the south-side window. He knelt down, retrieved the Ashmolean bar from his bag, and held it up against the rod. Robin noticed then a number of etchings in the side of the rod that corresponded with similar etchings in the bar. \u2018They\u2019ve got to be smelted from the same material. And then there\u2019s a good deal of etymological symbol work \u2013 you\u2019ll learn all of that in your fourth year, if you specialize in silver-working.",
    "We actually use an invented alphabet, based on a manuscript first discovered by an alchemist from Prague in the seventeenth century.* It\u2019s so that no one outside Babel can replicate our process. For now, you can think of all this adjustment as deepening the bond of connection.\u2019.",
    "\u2018They don\u2019t to manifest meaning,\u2019 said Professor Chakravarti. \u2018As a linking mechanism, however, they work quite well. We could do with basic numbers, but Playfair likes his mysteries. Keeps things proprietary.\u2019",
    "Robin stood awhile in silence, watching as Professor Chakravarti adjusted the etchings on the Ashmolean bar with a fine stylus, examined them with a lens, and then made corresponding adjustments to the resonance rod. The whole process took about fifteen minutes. At last, Professor Chakravarti wrapped the Ashmolean bar back up in velvet, returned it to his bag, and stood up. \u2018That should do the trick. We\u2019ll head back to the museum tomorrow.\u2019",
    "They stood together at the window. Looking out over Oxford, Robin had the impression that the whole city was like a finely tuned music box, relying wholly on its silver gears to keep running; and that if the silver ever ran out, if these resonance rods ever collapsed, then the whole of Oxford would stop abruptly in its tracks. The bell towers would go mute, the cabs would halt on the roads, and the townsfolk would freeze in motion on the street, limbs lifted in midair, mouths open in midspeech.",
    "But he couldn\u2019t imagine that it would ever run out. London, and Babel, were getting richer every day, for the same ships fuelled by long-enduring silver-work brought back chests and chests of silver in return. There wasn\u2019t a market on earth that could resist British incursion, not even the Far East. The only thing that would disrupt the inflow of silver was the collapse of the entire global economy, and since that was ridiculous, the Silver City, and the delights of Oxford, seemed eternal.",
    "\u2018Anthony went missing during a research expedition to Barbados last summer,\u2019 said Professor Playfair. \u2018He disappeared the night before his ship was due to return to Bristol, and we haven\u2019t heard from him since. We\u2019re presuming he\u2019s dead. His colleagues on the eighth floor are quite upset; I believe they\u2019ll be wearing black for the rest of the week. A few of the other cohorts and fellows have joined in, if you care to participate.\u2019",
    "He said this with such casual unconcern that they might have been discussing whether they wanted to go punting that afternoon. Robin gaped at him. \u2018But isn\u2019t he \u2013 aren\u2019t you \u2013 I mean, doesn\u2019t he have family? Have they been told?\u2019",
    "Professor Playfair scribbled an outline for that day\u2019s lecture on the chalkboard as he answered. \u2018Anthony has no family except his guardian. Mr Falwell\u2019s been notified by post, and I hear he\u2019s quite upset.\u2019",
    "She said this with a solicitous glance at Victoire, who among them had known Anthony the best. But Victoire looked surprisingly unfazed; she didn\u2019t seem shocked or upset so much as vaguely uncomfortable. Indeed, she looked as if she hoped they might change topics as quickly as possible. Professor Playfair was more than happy to oblige.",
    "Babel did not mourn Anthony. The faculty did not so much as hold a memorial service. The next time Robin went up to the silver-working floor, a wheat-haired graduate fellow he didn\u2019t know had taken over Anthony\u2019s workstation.",
    "Her distress belied a deeper terror, a terror which Robin felt as well, which was that Anthony had been expendable. That they were all expendable. That this tower \u2013 this place where they had for the first time found belonging \u2013 treasured and loved them when they were alive and useful but didn\u2019t, in fact, care about them at all. That they were, in the end, only vessels for the languages they spoke.",
    "Of them all, Robin had assumed Victoire would be most devastated. She and Anthony had grown quite close over the years; they were two of only a handful of Black scholars in the tower, and they were both born in the West Indies. Occasionally he\u2019d seen them talking, heads bent together, as they walked from the tower to the Buttery.",
    "But he never once saw her cry that winter. He wanted to comfort her, but he did not know how, especially as it seemed impossible to broach the topic with her. Whenever Anthony was brought up, she flinched, blinked rapidly, and then tried very hard to change the subject.",
    "\u2018Did you know Anthony was a slave?\u2019 Letty asked one night in hall. Unlike Victoire, she was determined to raise the issue at every opportunity; indeed, she was obsessed with Anthony\u2019s death in a way that felt uncomfortably, performatively righteous. \u2018Or would have been. His master didn\u2019t want him freed when abolition took effect, so he was going to take him to America, and he only got to stay at Oxford because Babel paid for his freedom. Paid. Can you believe it?\u2019",
    "They were well into Hilary term before Griffin resurfaced. So many months had passed by then that Robin had stopped checking his window with his usual rigour, and he would have missed the note if he had not spotted a magpie trying in vain to retrieve it from under the pane.",
    "The note instructed Robin to show up at the Twisted Root at half past two the next day, but Griffin was nearly an hour late. When he did arrive, Robin was astounded by his haggard appearance. The sheer act of walking through the pub seemed to exhaust him; by the time he sat down, he was breathing as hard as if he\u2019d just run the length of Parks. He\u2019d clearly not had a change of clothes in days; his smell wafted, attracting glares. He moved with a slight limp, and Robin glimpsed bandages under his shirt every time he raised his arm.",
    "Robin was not sure what to do with this. He\u2019d had a rant prepared for this meeting, but the words died at the sight of his brother\u2019s obvious misery. Instead, he sat silently as Griffin ordered shepherd\u2019s pie and two glasses of ale.",
    "A long silence passed. Robin felt vaguely guilty, though he had no good reason to be; still, a worm of discomfort ate further into his gut with every passing second. Food came. The plate was steaming hot, but Griffin wolfed his down like a man starved. And he just might have been, too; when he bent over his place, his collarbones protruded in a way that hurt to look at.",
    "\u2018Anyhow, here\u2019s a list of texts I need from the library.\u2019 Griffin reached into his front pocket and pulled out a crumpled note. \u2018You might have some trouble finding the Arabic volumes \u2013 I\u2019ve transliterated the titles for you, which will get you to the right shelf, but then you\u2019ll have to identify them on your own. But they\u2019re in the Bodleian, not the tower, so you won\u2019t have to worry about someone wondering what you\u2019re up to.\u2019",
    "\u2018Really?\u2019 Robin couldn\u2019t suppress it anymore. He expected callousness from Griffin, but not this blank pretence of ignorance. His sympathy evaporated, along with his patience; now the resentment, which he\u2019d kept simmering for a year, rushed to the fore. \u2018You\u2019re sure?\u2019",
    "\u2018I don\u2019t see why we\u2019re labouring the point. I made a mistake, you got away, it won\u2019t happen again. We\u2019re going to stop sending people in with you. Instead you\u2019ll drop off the contraband outside on your own\u2014\u2019",
    "\u2018Please don\u2019t be so dramatic.\u2019 Griffin sighed. \u2018Accidents happen. And you\u2019re fine.\u2019 He paused, considering, and then said more quietly, \u2018Look, if this will make you feel better, there\u2019s a safe house on St Aldate\u2019s we use when we need to hide out for a bit. There\u2019s a basement door by the church \u2013 it looks rusted shut, but you\u2019ve only got to look for where the bar\u2019s installed and say the words. It leads to a tunnel end that got overlooked when they did the renovations\u2014\u2019",
    "\u2018We\u2019ll be better next time,\u2019 Griffin insisted. \u2018That was a slip-up, that was my fault, we\u2019re adjusting for it. So calm down before someone overhears.\u2019 He settled back in his chair. \u2018Now. I\u2019ve been out of town for months, so I need to hear what\u2019s been going on at the tower, and I\u2019d like you to be efficient about it, please.\u2019",
    "He was getting nothing out of his brother, he knew. Griffin, like Professor Lovell, could be astonishingly single-minded; if something did not suit them, they simply failed to acknowledge it, and indeed any attempt to procure acknowledgment would only end in more frustration. He had the fleeting impulse simply to stand up and walk away, if only to see Griffin\u2019s expression. But that would grant no lasting satisfaction. If he turned back around, Griffin would mock him; if he kept walking out, he would only have severed his own ties to Hermes.",
    "\u2018Not much,\u2019 he said after a calming breath. \u2018The professors haven\u2019t been travelling abroad recently, and I don\u2019t think the wards have changed since last time either. Oh \u2013 something terrible happened. A graduate fellow \u2013 Anthony Ribben\u2014\u2019",
    "\u2018But it\u2019s just . . . it feels wrong. That they won\u2019t even give him a memorial. They\u2019re just carrying on like it never happened. It\u2019s . . .\u2019 Robin trailed off. Suddenly he wanted to cry. He felt foolish for bringing this up. He didn\u2019t know what he had wanted \u2013 some kind of validation, perhaps, that Anthony\u2019s life had mattered and that he could not be so easily forgotten. But Griffin, he should have known, was the worst person from whom to seek comfort.",
    "Griffin was silent for a long time. He stared out of the window, brows furrowed in concentration as if he were pondering something. He didn\u2019t seem to be listening to Robin at all. Then he cocked his head, opened his mouth, closed it, then opened it again. \u2018You know, that\u2019s not a surprise. The way Babel treats its students, particularly those they recruit from abroad. You\u2019re an asset to them, but that\u2019s all you are. A translation machine. And once you fail them, you\u2019re out.\u2019",
    "\u2018We\u2019re done?\u2019 Robin asked, startled. He felt a fresh wave of disappointment. He didn\u2019t know what he wanted from Griffin, or indeed if Griffin was capable of giving it, but still he\u2019d hoped for more than this.",
    "Something had poisoned Oxford, had sucked out everything about the university that gave Robin joy. The nights felt colder, the rains heavier. The tower no longer felt like a paradise but a prison. Coursework was torture. He and his friends took no pleasure in their studies; they felt neither the thrilling discovery of their first year nor the satisfaction of actually working with silver that might one day come with their fourth.",
    "The older cohorts assured them that this always happened, that the third-year slump was normal and inevitable. But that year seemed a markedly bad year in several other respects. For one, the number of assaults on the tower rose alarmingly. Before, Babel could expect two to three attempted break-ins per year, all of which were the subject of great spectacle as the students crowded around the doors to see what cruel effect Playfair\u2019s wards had wrought that time.",
    "But by February of that year, the attempted thefts started happening nearly every week, and the students began to grow sick of the sight of policemen dragging maimed perpetrators down the cobblestones..",
    "They weren\u2019t only targeted by thieves. The base of the tower was constantly being defiled, usually with urine, broken bottles, and spilt booze. Twice they discovered graffiti painted overnight in large, crooked scarlet letters. TONGUES OF SATAN read the one on the back wall; DEVIL\u2019S SILVER read the one beneath the first-floor window.",
    "Another morning, Robin and his cohort arrived to find dozens of townsmen assembled on the green, shouting viciously at the scholars going in and out of the front door. They approached cautiously. The crowd was a bit frightening, but not so dense that they couldn\u2019t weave their way through. Perhaps it said something that they were willing to risk a mob rather than miss class, but it really looked like they might get by without harassment until a large man stepped in front of Victoire and began snarling something in a rough and incomprehensible northern accent.",
    "\u2018Christ!\u2019 Ramy lurched forward like he\u2019d been shot. Victoire yelped. Robin\u2019s heart stopped. But it was only an egg, he saw; it was aimed at Victoire, and Ramy had lurched because he\u2019d stepped forward to protect her. Victoire flinched back, arms shielding her face; Ramy put an arm around her shoulder and ushered her up the front steps.",
    "Inside the lobby, students and clients alike were clustered at the wall, watching the crowd through the windows. Robin\u2019s first instinct was to wonder if this was the work of Hermes. But it couldn\u2019t be \u2013 Griffin\u2019s thefts were so meticulously planned; they belied a far more sophisticated apparatus than this furious mob.",
    "\u2018Oh, they\u2019ve laid off several hundred workers,\u2019 said Vimal, who\u2019d overheard. \u2018Supposedly it\u2019s a brilliant match-pair, something Professor Playfair came up with, and it\u2019s netted us enough to fund renovations for the entire east wing of the lobby. Which doesn\u2019t surprise me, if it can do the work of all those men combined.\u2019",
    "Upstairs in their Etymology class, Professor Lovell expressed a decidedly more cruel opinion. \u2018Don\u2019t worry about them. Just the usual riffraff. Drunkards, malcontents from up north, lowlifes with no better way to express their opinions than shouting about them on the street. I\u2019d prefer they wrote a letter, of course, but I doubt half of them can read.\u2019",
    "\u2018Well, of course. The sort of labour they do is redundant now. It should have been made redundant long ago; there\u2019s simply no reason that weaving, spinning, carding, or roving hasn\u2019t all been mechanized already. This is simply human progress.\u2019",
    "\u2018Oh, they\u2019re furious for sure,\u2019 said Professor Lovell. \u2018You can imagine why. What has silver-working done for this country over the past decade? Increased agricultural and industrial productivity to an unimaginable extent. It\u2019s made factories so efficient they can run with a quarter of their workers. Take the textile industry \u2013 Kay\u2019s flying shuttle, Arkwright\u2019s water frame, Crompton\u2019s spinning mule, and Cartwright\u2019s loom were all made possible with silver-working. Silver-working has catapulted Britain ahead of every other nation, and put thousands of labourers out of work in the process.",
    "So instead of using their wits to learn a skill that might actually be useful, they\u2019ve decided to whine about it on our front steps. Those protests outside aren\u2019t anything new, you know. There\u2019s a sickness in this country.\u2019 Professor Lovell spoke now with a sudden, nasty vehemence. \u2018It started with the Luddites \u2013 some idiot workers in Nottingham who thought they\u2019d rather smash machinery than adapt to progress \u2013 and it\u2019s spread across England since. There are people all over the country who\u2019d rather see us dead.",
    "It\u2019s not just Babel that gets attacked like this; no, we don\u2019t even see the worst of it, since our security\u2019s better than most. Up north, those men are pulling off arson, they\u2019re stoning building owners, they\u2019re throwing acid on factory managers. They can\u2019t seem to stop smashing looms in Lancashire. No, this isn\u2019t the first time our faculty have received death threats, it\u2019s only the first time they\u2019ve dared to come as far south as Oxford.\u2019.",
    "Professor Lovell scoffed. \u2018Never. I look at those men, and I think of the vast differences between us. I am where I am because I believe in knowledge and scientific progress, and I have used them to my advantage. They are where they are because they have stubbornly refused to move forward with the future. Men like that don\u2019t scare me. Men like that make me laugh.\u2019",
    "\u2018Not for long,\u2019 Professor Lovell assured her. \u2018No, they\u2019ll have cleared off by this evening. Those men have no persistence. They\u2019ll be gone by sunset once they get hungry, or once they wander off in search of a drink. And if they don\u2019t, the wards and the police will move them on.\u2019",
    "But Professor Lovell was wrong. This wasn\u2019t the work of an isolated handful of discontents, nor did they simply dissipate overnight. The police did clear the crowd away that morning, but they returned in smaller numbers; several times a week, a dozen or so men showed up to harass scholars on their way into the tower. One morning, the entire building had to be evacuated when a package making a ticking noise was delivered to Professor Playfair\u2019s office. It turned out to be a clock connected to an explosive. Fortunately, rain had soaked through the package, eroding the fuse.",
    "Security at the tower doubled overnight. The post was now received and sorted by newly hired clerks at a processing centre halfway across Oxford. A rotating team of policemen guarded the tower entrance at all hours. Professor Playfair installed a new set of silver bars over the front door, though as usual he refused to reveal what match-pairs he\u2019d inscribed them with, or what they would do when triggered.",
    "These protests were not the symptoms of a minor disturbance. Something was happening throughout England, a set of changes the consequences of which they were only beginning to fathom. Oxford, which consistently ran about a century behind the rest of England\u2019s major cities, could only pretend to be immune to change for so long. The vicissitudes of the world outside had now become impossible to ignore. This was about more than mill workers. Reform, unrest, and inequality were the keywords of the decade.",
    "The full impact of a so-called silver industrial revolution, a term coined by Peter Gaskell just six years before, was just beginning to be felt across the country. Silver-powered machines of the kind William Blake dubbed \u2018dark Satanic Mills\u2019 were rapidly replacing artisanal labour, but rather than bringing prosperity to all, they had instead created an economic recession, had caused a widening gap between the rich and poor that would soon become the stuff of novels by Disraeli and Dickens.",
    "Rural agriculture was in decline; men, women, and children moved en masse to urban centres to work in factories, where they laboured unimaginably long hours and lost limbs and lives in frightful accidents. The New Poor Law of 1834, which had been designed to reduce the costs of poverty relief more than anything else, was fundamentally cruel and punitive in design; it withheld financial aid unless applicants moved into a workhouse, and those workhouses were designed to be so miserable no one would want to live in them.",
    "Professor Lovell\u2019s promised future of progress and enlightenment seemed only to have wrought poverty and suffering; the new jobs he thought the displaced workers should take up never materialized. Truly, the only ones who seemed to profit from the silver industrial revolution were those who were already rich, and the select few others who were cunning or lucky enough to make themselves so..",
    "These currents were unsustainable. The gears of history were turning fast in England. The world was getting smaller, more mechanized, and more unequal, and it was as yet unclear where things would end up, or what that would mean for Babel, or for the Empire itself.",
    "Robin and his cohort, though, did what scholars always did, which was to bend their heads over their books and focus solely on their research. The protestors eventually dispersed after troops sent in from London dragged the ringleaders off to Newgate. The scholars stopped holding their breath every time they ascended the steps to the tower. They learned to put up with the swarming police presence, along with the fact that now it took twice as long for new books and correspondence to arrive.",
    "One stormy night, on his way to dinner at Professor Lovell\u2019s home, Robin glimpsed a family sitting at the corner of Woodstock Road holding out tin mugs for alms. Beggars were a common sight in Oxford\u2019s outskirts, but entire families were rare. The two small children gave him little waves as he approached, and the sight of their pale, rain-streaked faces made him feel guilty enough to stop and fish several pennies out of his pocket.",
    "The man\u2019s beard had grown out, and his clothes had got a good deal tattier, but Robin still recognized him \u2013 he was, without question, one of the men who had screamed obscenities at him on his way into the tower several weeks ago. He met Robin\u2019s eyes. It wasn\u2019t clear if he recognized Robin as well; he opened his mouth to say something, but Robin quickened his pace, and whatever the man might have called after him was soon drowned out by the wind and the rain.",
    "He didn\u2019t mention the family to Mrs Piper or Professor Lovell. He didn\u2019t want to dwell on all the things they represented \u2013 the fact that for all of his professed allegiance to revolution, for his commitment to equality and to helping those who were without, he had no experience of true poverty at all. He\u2019d seen hard times in Canton, but he had never not known where his next meal might come from or where he would sleep at night. He had never looked at his family and wondered what it might take to keep them alive.",
    "That night he ate his dinner, smiled at Mrs Piper\u2019s compliments, and shared a bottle of wine with Professor Lovell. He walked a different route back to the college. The next month, he forgot to take the same detour on his way up, but it didn\u2019t matter \u2013 by then, the little family was already gone.",
    "Looming exams made a bad year awful. Babel scholars underwent two rounds of exams \u2013 one at the end of their third year, and another during their fourth. These were staggered throughout the calendar; the fourth years sat their exams in the middle of Hilary term, while the third years had until Trinity term. The effect was that starting after the winter holidays, the mood in the tower was utterly changed.",
    "Traditionally, Babel publicly announced the fourth years\u2019 marks at the end of the examination period. At noon on Friday of that week, a bell rang three times throughout the tower. Everyone stood and hurried downstairs to the lobby, where that afternoon\u2019s clients were being ushered out the door. Professor Playfair stood on a table at the centre of the room. He was dressed in an ornate gown with purple edges, holding aloft the kind of curling scroll that Robin had only ever seen in medieval illuminations.",
    "Once the tower had been cleared of everyone not affiliated with the faculty, he cleared his throat and intoned, \u2018The following degree candidates have passed their qualifying exams with distinction. Matthew Houndslow\u2014\u2019.",
    "\u2018Most cruel and unusual,\u2019 Robin agreed. But he couldn\u2019t take his eye off the proceedings. He wasn\u2019t up for examination yet, but it was so much closer now, and his heart was pounding hard with vicarious terror. As horrific as this was, it was also still exciting, this public declaration of who had proven themselves brilliant and who hadn\u2019t.",
    "Only Matthew and Adam had won distinction. Professor Playfair announced a merit (James Fairfield) and a pass (Luke McCaffrey), then said in a very sombre voice, \u2018The following candidate failed their qualifying exams, and will not be asked to return to the Royal Institute of Translation for a postgraduate fellowship, nor will they be awarded a degree. Philip Wright.\u2019",
    "Wright was the French and German specialist who had sat beside Robin at the faculty dinner during his first year. Over the years, he had grown thin and haggard-looking. He was one of the students who constantly lurked around at the library looking as if he hadn\u2019t bathed or shaved in days, staring at the stack of papers before him with a mixture of panic and bewilderment.",
    "\u2018You\u2019ve been offered every lenience,\u2019 Professor Playfair said. \u2018You\u2019ve been granted more accommodations than was good for you, I think. Now it\u2019s time to acknowledge this is the end of your time here, Mr Wright.\u2019",
    "Wright made as if to approach Professor Playfair, but two graduate fellows seized him by the arms and pulled him back. He began to beg, babbling about how his exam response had been misinterpreted, how he could clarify everything if only he got another chance. Professor Playfair stood placidly with his hands held behind his back, pretending not to listen.",
    "\u2018Gave a folk etymology instead of a real one.\u2019 Vimal shook his head dramatically. \u2018Tried to link canards to canaries, you see, except canaries aren\u2019t related to canard ducks \u2013 they\u2019re from the Canary Islands, which are named after dogs\u2014\u2019",
    "Professor Playfair pulled a glass vial out of his inner pocket \u2013 the vial, Robin assumed, that contained Wright\u2019s blood. He placed it on the table and stomped down. Glass shards and brown flecks scattered across the floor. Wright began howling. It wasn\u2019t clear what the breaking of the vial had actually done to him \u2013 all four limbs seemed intact, as far as Robin could tell, and there was no fresh blood \u2013 but Wright collapsed to the floor, clutching his midriff as if he\u2019d been impaled.",
    "It took a third graduate fellow to pull Wright to his feet, drag him to the front door, and fling him unceremoniously down the steps. Everyone else watched, mouths hanging open. Such a grotesque ceremony seemed unbefitting of a modern academic institution. Yet this was utterly appropriate. Oxford, and Babel by extension, were, at their roots, ancient religious institutions, and for all their contemporary sophistication, the rituals that comprised university life were still based in medieval mysticism. Oxford was Anglicanism was Christianity, which meant blood, flesh, and dirt.*",
    "Two days later Griffin asked Robin to meet him at a tavern in Iffley, nearly an hour\u2019s walk from the college. It was a dim, noisy place. It took Robin a moment to find his brother, who was sitting slouched near the back. Whatever he\u2019d been up to since their last meeting, he apparently hadn\u2019t been eating; he had two steaming shepherd\u2019s pies before him and was wolfing one down with no fear of scalding his tongue.",
    "\u2018I get supper here sometimes,\u2019 said Griffin. \u2018The food\u2019s awful but there\u2019s a lot of it, and importantly, nobody from the university ever comes out here. It\u2019s too close to the \u2013 what did Playfair call them? The locals.\u2019",
    "He looked worse than he\u2019d been all term \u2013 visibly exhausted, hollow-cheeked, and whittled down to a sharp, lean core. He gave off the air of a shipwreck survivor, of someone who\u2019d travelled long distances and barely made it out alive \u2013 though of course he wouldn\u2019t tell Robin where he\u2019d been. His black coat, hanging off the chair behind him, reeked.",
    "\u2018Are you all right?\u2019 Robin pointed to Griffin\u2019s left arm. It was wrapped in bandages, but whatever wound lay beneath was clearly still open, because the dark stain over his forearm had spread visibly since Robin had sat down.",
    "\u2018Ha. No, we\u2019ve got someone. I\u2019ll have it looked at later.\u2019 Griffin pulled his sleeve over the bandages. \u2018Anyhow. I need you ready next week. It\u2019s very touch-and-go, so I don\u2019t yet have a good idea of the time or day, but it\u2019s a big one \u2013 they\u2019re expecting a massive shipment of silver in from Magniac & Smith, and we\u2019d love to get a crate during the unloading. It\u2019ll take a large distraction, of course. I might need to store some explosives in your room for quick access\u2014\u2019",
    "\u2018But I don\u2019t,\u2019 Robin blurted. His heart beat very quickly, but it was too late now to hold his silence. He had to say it all at once; he couldn\u2019t keep biting down on his words forever. \u2018I don\u2019t trust you. You\u2019re getting messy.\u2019",
    "\u2018You don\u2019t show up for weeks, and when you do you\u2019re late half the time; your instructions are all scratched out and revised so many times that it takes skill, really, to decipher what they say. Babel\u2019s security has nearly tripled, but you don\u2019t seem interested in working out how to deal with it. And you still haven\u2019t explained what happened last time, or what your new workaround for the wards is. I was shot in the arm and you don\u2019t seem to care\u2014\u2019",
    "\u2018Yes, it\u2019s quite clear.\u2019 Griffin\u2019s lip curled. He looked very much like their father just then. \u2018You have such a great fear of freedom, brother. It\u2019s shackling you. You\u2019ve identified so hard with the colonizer, you think any threat to them is a threat to you. When are you going to realize you can\u2019t be one of them?\u2019",
    "\u2018Don\u2019t you read the news? The British are going to pull Afghanistan into their sphere of influence. But there are plans in motion to make sure that doesn\u2019t happen \u2013 and that I really can\u2019t tell you about, brother\u2014\u2019",
    "\u2018You\u2019re all talk,\u2019 Robin said, amazed. Something in his mind shattered then \u2013 the illusion that he ought to admire Griffin, that Hermes mattered at all. \u2018It makes you feel important, doesn\u2019t it? Acting like you\u2019ve got some leverage over the world? I\u2019ve seen the men who really pull the levers, and they\u2019re nothing like you. They don\u2019t have to scramble for power. They don\u2019t organize silly midnight heists and put their kid brothers in jeopardy in some wild attempt to obtain it. They\u2019ve already got it.\u2019",
    "\u2018What do you do?\u2019 Robin demanded. \u2018Really, Griffin, what on earth have you ever done? The Empire\u2019s still standing. Babel\u2019s still there. The sun rises, and Britain\u2019s still got her claws everywhere in the world, and silver keeps flowing in without end. None of this matters.\u2019",
    "\u2018No, I just\u2014\u2019 Robin felt a sharp twinge of guilt. He\u2019d spoken too harshly perhaps, but his point, he thought, was fair. \u2018I just can\u2019t see what any of this achieves. And you\u2019re asking me to give up so much in return. I want to help you, Griffin. But I also want to survive.\u2019",
    "Griffin did not respond for a long while. Robin sat watching him, growing increasingly uncomfortable as he calmly finished the last of his shepherd\u2019s pie. Then he set down his fork and meticulously wiped his mouth with a napkin.",
    "\u2018You know the funny thing about Afghanistan?\u2019 Griffin\u2019s voice was very soft. \u2018The British aren\u2019t going to invade with English troops. They\u2019re going to invade with troops from Bengal and Bombay. They\u2019re going to have sepoys fight the Afghans, just like they had sepoys fight and die for them at Irrawaddy, because those Indian troops have the same logic you do, which is that it\u2019s better to be a servant of the Empire, brutal coercion and all, than to resist. Because it\u2019s safe. Because it\u2019s stable, because it lets them survive. And that\u2019s how they win, brother. They pit us against each other.",
    "There was nothing Robin could say to that. He knew Griffin was not bluffing, but also that if Griffin really did not trust him, he would not make it back to the college alive. They watched each other for a long time, unspeaking.",
    "At last, Griffin shook his head and said, \u2018You\u2019re lost, brother. You\u2019re a ship adrift, searching for familiar shores. I understand what it is you want. I sought it too. But there is no homeland. It\u2019s gone.\u2019 He paused beside Robin on his way to the door. His fingers landed on Robin\u2019s shoulder, squeezed so hard they hurt. \u2018But realize this, brother. You fly no one\u2019s flag. You\u2019re free to seek your own harbour. And you can do so much more than tread water.\u2019",
    "Griffin made good on his word. He never left another note for Robin. At first, Robin was sure Griffin would merely take some time to sulk before pestering him again for smaller, more routine errands. But a week became a month, which became a term. He\u2019d expected Griffin to be a bit more vindictive \u2013 to leave a recriminating farewell letter, at least. For the first few days after their falling-out, he flinched every time a stranger glanced his way on the street, convinced that the Hermes Society had decided it best to tie up this loose end.",
    "He tried not to let his conscience bother him. Hermes was not going anywhere. There would always be battles to fight. They would all be there waiting when Robin was ready to rejoin them, he was sure. And he could do nothing for Hermes if he did not remain firmly ensconced within Babel\u2019s ecosystem. Griffin had said it himself \u2013 they needed people on the inside. Wasn\u2019t that reason enough to stay right where he was?",
    "Meanwhile, there were third-year exams. End-of-year exams were quite a matter of ceremony at Oxford. Up until the last years of the previous century, viva voce exams \u2013 oral questioning ordeals made public for crowds of spectators to witness \u2013 had been the norm, although by the early 1830s the regular BA degree required only five written examinations and one viva voce exam, on the grounds that oral responses were too difficult to assess objectively and were unnecessarily cruel besides.",
    "Instead, Robin\u2019s cohort was told to expect a three-hour essay exam in each of their research languages; a three-hour essay exam in Etymology; a viva voce exam in Translation Theory, and a silver-working test. They could not stay on at Babel if they failed any of their language or theory exams, and if they failed the silver-working test, they could not, in the future, work on the eighth floor.*",
    "The viva voce would be done in front of a panel of three professors led by Professor Playfair, who was a notoriously tough examiner, and who was rumoured to make at least two students dissolve into tears every year. \u2018Balderdash,\u2019 he would drawl slowly, \u2018is a word which used to refer to the cursed concoction created by bartenders when they\u2019d nearly run out of every drink at the end of the night. Ale, wine, cider, milk \u2013 they\u2019d dump it all in and hope their patrons wouldn\u2019t mind, since after all the goal was simply to get drunk.",
    "Time, which had felt infinite during their first and second years, now ran quickly down the hourglass. No longer could they put off their readings to have a lark on the river under the assumption there was always the opportunity later to catch up. Exams were in five weeks, then four, then three. When Trinity term drew to an end, the last day of class should have culminated in a golden afternoon, in desserts and elderflower cordial and punting on the Cherwell.",
    "But the moment the bells rang at four, they packed up their books and walked straight from Professor Craft\u2019s classroom to one of the study rooms on the fifth floor, where they would wall themselves in, every day for the next thirteen days, to pore over dictionaries and translated passages and vocabulary lists until their temples throbbed..",
    "Acting from generosity, or perhaps sadism, the Babel faculty made available a set of silver bars for examinees to use as study aids. These bars were engraved with a match-pair using the English word meticulous and its Latin forerunner metus, meaning \u2018fear, dread\u2019. The modern usage of meticulous had arisen just a few decades before in France, with the connotation of being fearful of making a mistake. The effect of the bars was to induce a chilling anxiety whenever the user erred in their work.",
    "\u2018The more I get done, the larger range I\u2019ve acquired for the possible paper questions,\u2019 said Ramy. \u2018And that\u2019s what we\u2019ve really got to prepare for. I don\u2019t want to go blank when the paper\u2019s in front of me.\u2019",
    "This was a valid worry. Stress had the unique ability to wipe students\u2019 minds clear of things they had been studying for years. During the fourth-year exams last year, one examinee was rumoured to have become so paranoid that he declared not only that he could not finish the exam but that he was lying about being fluent in French at all.",
    "(He was in fact a native speaker.) They all thought they were immune to this particular folly until one day, a week before exams, Letty suddenly broke down crying and declared she knew not a word of German, not a single word, that she was a fraud and her entire career at Babel had been based on pretence. None of them understood this rant until much later, for she had indeed delivered it in German..",
    "Failure of memory was only the first symptom to come. Never had Robin\u2019s anxiety over his marks made him so physically ill. First came a persistent, throbbing headache, and then the constant urge to throw up every time he stood or moved. Waves of tremors kept coming over him with no warning; often his hand shook so hard that he had difficulty gripping his pen. Once, during a practice paper, he found his vision blacking out; he couldn\u2019t think, couldn\u2019t remember a single word, couldn\u2019t even see. It took him nearly ten minutes to recover. He couldn\u2019t make himself eat.",
    "Then, like all good Oxford upperclassmen, he found himself losing his mind. His grip on reality, already tenuous from sustained isolation in a city of scholars, became even more fragmented. Hours of revision had interfered with his processing of signs and symbols, his belief in what was real and what was not. The abstract was factual and important; daily exigencies like porridge and eggs were suspect. Everyday dialogue became a chore; small talk was a horror, and he lost his grip on what basic salutations meant.",
    "It relieved Robin to hear he wasn\u2019t the only one seeing things, because the visions worried him the most. He\u2019d begun to hallucinate entire persons. Once when hunting through the bookshelves at Thornton\u2019s for a poetry anthology on their Latin reading list, Robin glimpsed what he thought was a familiar profile by the door. He walked closer. His eyes had not betrayed him \u2013 Anthony Ribben was paying for a paper-wrapped parcel, hale and healthy as could be.",
    "Anthony glanced up. He saw Robin. His eyes widened. Robin started forward, confused yet elated, but Anthony hastily pushed several coins at the bookseller and darted out of the shop. By the time Robin made his way out onto Magdalene Street, Anthony had disappeared from sight. Robin stared around for several seconds, then returned to the bookshop, wondering if it was possible he\u2019d mistaken a stranger for Anthony. But there were not many young Black men in Oxford.",
    "Which meant either he\u2019d been lied to about Anthony\u2019s death \u2013 that indeed, all of Babel\u2019s faculty had done it as some elaborate hoax \u2013 or he\u2019d imagined the whole thing. In his current state, he found the latter far more likely..",
    "The exam they all dreaded most was the silver-working test. During the last week of Trinity term, they\u2019d been informed they\u2019d have to devise a unique match-pair and engrave it in front of a proctor. In their fourth year, once they had finished their apprenticeships, they would learn proper techniques of match-pair design, engraving, and experimentation for magnitude and duration of effect, as well as the intricacies of resonance links and spoken manifestation. But for now, armed with just the basic principles of how match-pairs worked, they had only to achieve any effect at all.",
    "It did not need to be perfect; indeed, first tries never were. But they had to do something. They had to prove they possessed the undefinable stuff, the inimitable instinct for meaning, that made a translator a silver-worker..",
    "Help from postgraduates here was technically forbidden, but sweet, kind Cathy O\u2019Nell surreptitiously slipped Robin a faded yellow pamphlet on the basics of match-pair research one afternoon when she caught him looking dazed and scared in the library.",
    "The pamphlet was rather dated \u2013 it was written in 1798, and employed many archaic spellings \u2013 but did contain a number of brief, easily digestible tips. The first was to stay away from religion. This one they already knew from dozens of horror stories. It was theology that had got Oxford interested in Oriental languages in the first place \u2013 the only reason Hebrew, Arabic, and Syriac had initially become subjects of academic study was the translation of religious texts. But the Holy Word, it turned out, was both unpredictable and unforgiving on silver.",
    "There was a desk in the north wing of the eighth floor that no one dared approach because it still occasionally emitted smoke from an unseen source. There, it was rumoured, some foolish graduate fellow had attempted to translate on silver the name of God..",
    "More helpful was the second lesson in the pamphlet, which was to focus their research by looking for cognates. Cognates \u2013 words in different languages that shared a common ancestor and often similar meanings as well* \u2013 were often the best clues for fruitful match-pairs, since they were on such close branches of the etymological tree. But the difficulty with cognates was that often their meanings were so close that there was little distortion in translation, and thus little effect that the bars could manifest.",
    "There was, after all, no significant difference between the word chocolate in English and in Spanish. Moreover, in looking for cognates, one had to be wary of false friends \u2013 words which seemed like cognates but had utterly different origins and meanings. The English have did not come from the Latin habere (\u2018to hold, to possess\u2019), for example, but from the Latin capere (\u2018to seek\u2019). And the Italian cognato did not mean \u2018cognate\u2019 like one might hope, but rather \u2018brother-in-law\u2019..",
    "False friends were especially tricky when their meanings appeared related as well. The Persian word farang, which was used to refer to Europeans, appeared to be a cognate of the English foreign. But farang actually arose from a reference to the Franks, and morphed to encompass Western Europeans. The English foreign, on the other hand, originated from the Latin fores, meaning \u2018doors\u2019. Linking farang and foreign, then, produced nothing.*",
    "The third lesson in the pamphlet introduced a technique called daisy-chaining. This they vaguely recalled from Professor Playfair\u2019s demonstration. If the words in their binary match-pair had evolved too far apart in meaning for a translation to be plausible, one could try adding a third or even fourth language as an intermediary. If all these words were engraved in chronological order of evolution, this could guide the distortion of meaning more precisely in the way they intended.",
    "Another related technique was the identification of a second etymon: another source that may have interfered in the evolution of meaning. The French fermer (\u2018to close, to lock\u2019) was for instance quite obviously based on the Latin firm\u0101re (\u2018to make hard, to strengthen\u2019) but had also been influenced by the Latin ferrum, meaning \u2018iron\u2019. Fermer, firm\u0101re, and ferrum could then, hypothetically, create an unbreakable lock..",
    "All these techniques sounded good in theory. They were much harder to replicate. The difficult part, after all, was coming up with a suitable match-pair in the first place. For inspiration, they took out a copy of the Current Ledger \u2013 the comprehensive list of match-pairs in use across the Empire in that year \u2013 and skimmed through it for ideas.",
    "\u2018That\u2019s true of the larger ones,\u2019 said Letty. \u2018But the smaller cargo trams aren\u2019t that big. Haven\u2019t you noticed they seem to pull themselves?\u2019 She jabbed excitedly at the page. \u2018There are bars in the track. Track is related to trecken, from Middle Dutch, which means to pull \u2013 especially when you go through the French intermediary. And now you have two words that mean what we think of as a track, but only one of them involves a moving force. The result is the tracks pull the carts forward themselves. That\u2019s brilliant.\u2019",
    "They could have spent hours alone reading the ledger, which was full of endlessly interesting and astonishingly brilliant innovations. Many, Robin discovered, had been devised by Professor Lovell. One particularly ingenious pair was the translation from the Chinese character g\u01d4 (\u53e4) meaning \u2018old or aged\u2019, and the English \u2018old\u2019. The Chinese g\u01d4 carried a connotation of durability and strength; indeed, the same character \u53e4 was present in the character g\u00f9 (\u56fa), which meant \u2018hard, strong, or solid\u2019.",
    "\u2018But no one\u2019s moved any of her things since that morning,\u2019 said Letty. \u2018I\u2019ve noticed. It\u2019s been months. And those books and pens are right where she left them. So either she\u2019s particular about her things to a frightening degree, or she hasn\u2019t been back at that desk at all.\u2019",
    "As they flipped through the ledger, another theory became more evident. Evie had been wildly prolific between the years 1833 and 1834, but by 1835, her research had dropped completely off the record. Not a single innovation in the past five years. They\u2019d never met an Evie Brooke at any of the departmental parties or dinners; she\u2019d given no lectures, no seminars. Whoever Eveline Brooke was, as brilliant as she\u2019d been, she was clearly no longer at Babel.",
    "In the late hours of the night, when they\u2019d been staring at their books for so long that they could no longer think straight, they made a game of conceiving implausible match-pairs that might help them pass.",
    "Robin won one night with j\u012bx\u012bn. \u2018In Canton, mothers would send their sons off to the imperial exams with a breakfast of chicken hearts,\u2019 he explained. \u2018Because chicken hearts \u2013 j\u012bx\u012bn \u2013 sounds similar to j\u00ecxing, which means memory.\u2019*",
    "\u2018Or make your heart the size of a chicken\u2019s,\u2019 said Victoire. \u2018Imagine, one moment you\u2019ve got a normal-size heart and the next it\u2019s smaller than a thimble, and it can\u2019t pump all the blood you need to survive, so you collapse\u2014\u2019",
    "\u2018No, this is easy,\u2019 said Letty. \u2018It\u2019s a metaphor of sacrifice \u2013 the key is the trade. The chicken\u2019s blood \u2013 the chicken\u2019s heart \u2013 is what supports your memory. So you\u2019ve only got to slaughter a chicken to the gods and you\u2019ll pass.\u2019",
    "They stared at each other. It was very late, and none of them had got enough sleep. They were all presently suffering the peculiar madness of the very scared and very determined, the madness that made academia feel as dangerous as the battlefield.",
    "The fated week came. They were as prepared as they could be. They\u2019d been promised a fair exam as long as they did their work, and they had done their work. They were frightened, of course, but warily confident. These exams, after all, were precisely what they had been trained to do for the last two and a half years; no more and no less.",
    "Professor Chakravarti\u2019s paper was easiest of all. Robin had to translate, unseen, a five-hundred-character-long passage in Classical Chinese that Professor Chakravarti had composed. It was a charming parable about a virtuous man who loses one goat in a mulberry field but finds another. Robin realized after the exam that he\u2019d mistranslated y\u00e0nsh\u01d0, which meant \u2018romantic history\u2019, as the tamer \u2018colourful history\u2019,* which missed the tone of the passage somewhat, but hoped the ambiguities between \u2018sexual\u2019 and \u2018colourful\u2019 in English would be enough to fudge things over.",
    "Professor Craft had written a devilishly difficult paper prompt about the fluid roles of the interpretes in the writings of Cicero. They were not simply interpreters, but played a number of roles such as brokers, mediators, and occasionally bribers. Robin\u2019s cohort were instructed to elaborate, then, on the use of language in this context. Robin scribbled an eight-page essay on how the term interpretes was, for Cicero, ultimately value neutral in comparison to Herodotus\u2019s hermeneus, one of whom was killed by Themistocles for using Greek on behalf of the Persians.",
    "He concluded with some comments on linguistic propriety and loyalty. He was truly unsure how he\u2019d performed when he walked out of the examination room \u2013 his mind had resorted to the funny trick of ceasing to understand what he\u2019d argued as soon as he dotted the last sentence, but the inky lines had looked robust, and he knew he\u2019d at least sounded good..",
    "Professor Lovell\u2019s paper involved two prompts. The first was a challenge to translate three pages of a children\u2019s nonsense alphabet rhyme (\u2018A is for the apricot, which was eaten by a Bear\u2019) into a language of their choosing. Robin spent fifteen minutes trying to match Chinese characters ordered by their romanizations before giving up and going the easy route, which was just to do it all in Latin.",
    "The second page contained an Ancient Egyptian fable told through hieroglyphs and its accompanying English translation with the instructions to identify as best they could, with no prior knowledge of the source language, the difficulties in conveying it into the target language. Here, Robin\u2019s facility with the pictorial nature of Chinese characters helped greatly; he came up with something about ideographic power and subtle visual implications and managed to get it all down before time ran out..",
    "The viva voce was not as bad as it could have been. Professor Playfair was as harsh as promised, but still an incorrigible showman, and Robin\u2019s anxiety dissipated as he realized how much of Playfair\u2019s loud condescension and indignation was for theatrics. \u2018Schlegel wrote in 1803 that the time was not so far away that German would be the speaking voice of the civilized world,\u2019 said Professor Playfair.",
    "\u2018Discuss.\u2019 Robin had fortunately read this piece by Schlegel in translation, and he knew Schlegel was referring to the unique and complex flexibility of German, which Robin proceeded to argue was an underestimation of other Occidental languages such as English (which Schlegel accused in that same piece of \u2018monosyllabic brevity\u2019) and French.",
    "This sentiment was also \u2013 Robin recalled hastily as his time ran out \u2013 the grasping argument of a German aware that the Germanic empire could offer no resistance to the increasingly dominant French, and who sought refuge instead in cultural and intellectual hegemony. This answer was neither particularly brilliant nor original, but it was correct, and Professor Playfair followed up on only a handful of technicalities before dismissing Robin from the room..",
    "Their silver-working test was scheduled for the last day. They were instructed to report to the eighth floor in thirty-minute increments \u2013 Letty first at noon, then Robin, then Ramy, then Victoire at half past one.",
    "At half past noon, Robin walked up all seven flights of the tower and stood waiting outside the windowless room at the back of the southern wing. His mouth was very dry. It was a sunny afternoon in May, but he couldn\u2019t stop the shivering in his knees.",
    "But fear, was, of course, not rational. His imagination ran wild with the thousand and one things that could go wrong. He could drop the bar on the floor, he could suffer a lapse of memory the moment he walked through the door, or he could forget a brush stroke or spell the English word wrong despite practising both a hundred times. Or it could fail to work. It could simply fail to work, and he would never get a position on the eighth floor. It could all be over that quickly.",
    "The room had been cleared of chairs, books, and shelves \u2013 anything valuable or breakable. Only one desk remained, in the corner, and that was bare save for a single blank silver bar and an engraving stylus.",
    "Robin\u2019s teeth were chattering too hard for him to speak. He hadn\u2019t known how debilitatingly scared he would be. The written exams had involved their fair share of shakes and retching, but when it came down to it, when his pen hit parchment, it felt routine. It had been nothing more and nothing less than the accumulation of everything he\u2019d practised for the past three years. This was something else entirely. He had no idea what to expect.",
    "\u2018M\u00edngbai,\u2019 Robin blurted. \u2018Mandarin. It means \u2013 so it means, \u201cto understand\u201d, right? But the characters are loaded with imagery. M\u00edng \u2013 bright, a light, clear. And bai \u2013 white, like the colour. So it doesn\u2019t just mean to understand, or to realize \u2013 it has the visual component of making clear, to shine a light on.\u2019 He paused to clear his throat. He was not quite so nervous anymore \u2013 the match-pair he\u2019d prepared did sound better when he spoke it out loud. In fact, it seemed halfway plausible.",
    "Robin took the bar in trembling hands and positioned the tip of the stylus against the smooth, blank surface. It took an unexpected amount of force to make the stylus etch out a clear line. This was, somehow, calming \u2013 it made him focus on keeping the pressure steady instead of the thousand other things he could do wrong.",
    "Something pulsed in the silver \u2013 something alive, something forceful and bold; a gale of wind, a crashing wave; and in that fraction of a second Robin felt the source of its power, that sublime, unnameable place where meaning was created, that place which words approximated but could not, could never pin down; the place which could only be invoked, imperfectly, but even so would make its presence felt. A bright, warm sphere of light shone out of the bar and grew until it enveloped them both.",
    "Robin had not specified what sort of understanding this light would signify; he had not planned that far; yet in that moment he knew perfectly and, from the look on Professor Chakravarti\u2019s face, his supervisor did too..",
    "Letty was waiting for him outside the tower. She\u2019d calmed significantly; the colour had returned to her cheeks, and her eyes were no longer wide with panic. She must have just dashed to the bakery up the street, for she held a crumpled paper bag in her hands.",
    "They grinned at each other. Robin savoured the taste of the biscuit melting in his mouth \u2013 he saw why these were Letty\u2019s favourite; they were so buttery that they dissolved instantly, and the lemony sweetness spread across his tongue like honey. They\u2019d done it. Everything was okay; the world could keep moving; nothing else mattered, because they\u2019d done it.",
    "Victoire took the longest. It was nearly an hour before she emerged from the building, scowling and flustered. Immediately Ramy was at her side, one arm slung around her shoulder. \u2018What happened? Are you all right?\u2019",
    "\u2018I gave them a Krey\u00f2l-French match-pair,\u2019 Victoire said. \u2018And it worked, worked like a charm, only Professor Leblanc said they couldn\u2019t put it in the Current Ledger because he didn\u2019t see how a Krey\u00f2l match-pair would be useful to anyone who doesn\u2019t speak Krey\u00f2l. And then I said it\u2019d be of great use to people in Haiti, and then he laughed.\u2019",
    "She\u2019d asked the wrong question. Robin saw a flash of irritation in Victoire\u2019s eyes, but it was gone in an instant. She sighed and nodded. \u2018Yes, the French-English one didn\u2019t work quite so well, and I was a bit too shaken so I think my handwriting was off, but it did have some effect.\u2019",
    "If only one could engrave entire memories in silver, thought Robin, to be manifested again and again for years to come \u2013 not the cruel distortion of the daguerreotype, but a pure and impossible distillation of emotions and sensations. For simple ink on paper was not enough to describe this golden afternoon; the warmth of uncomplicated friendship, all fights forgotten, all sins forgiven; the sunlight melting away the memory of the classroom chill; the sticky taste of lemon on their tongues and their startled, delighted relief.",
    "And then they were free. Not for long \u2013 they had the summer off, and then they would repeat all the miseries they\u2019d just endured, with twice the agony, during their fourth-year exams. But September felt so far away. It was only May, and the whole summer lay before them. It felt now as if they had all the time in the world to do nothing but be happy, if they could just remember how.",
    "Every three years University College held a commemoration ball. These balls were the pinnacle of Oxford social life; they were a chance for colleges to show off their lovely grounds and prodigious wine cellars, for the richer colleges to flaunt their endowments, and for the poorer colleges to try to claw their way up the ladder of prestige.",
    "Balls let colleges fling all their excess wealth that they didn\u2019t, for some reason, allocate to students in need at a grand occasion for their wealthy alumni, the financial justification being that wealth attracted wealth, and there was no better way to solicit donations for hall renovations than showing the old boys a good time. And what a very good time it was. Colleges competed each year to break records for sheer indulgence and spectacle.",
    "Letty was shaken, but only for a moment. Robin saw her hastily rearrange her features into a forced smile. Letty was relieved to be back in Victoire\u2019s good graces, he knew, and she\u2019d do anything to stay there. \u2018That\u2019s all right, you can make do with one of mine. You\u2019re a bit taller, but I can let out the hem. And I\u2019ve got so much jewellery to lend you \u2013 I can write back to Brighton and see if they\u2019ll send me some of Mama\u2019s old things. She had all these lovely pins \u2013 I\u2019d love to see what I can do with your hair\u2014\u2019",
    "\u2018Don\u2019t be ridiculous,\u2019 Letty scoffed. \u2018Balls are wonderful. You\u2019ve never seen anything like it. Lincoln brought me as his date to one at Balliol \u2013 oh, the whole place was transformed. I saw stage acts that you can\u2019t even see in London. And they\u2019re only once every three years; we won\u2019t be undergraduates next time. I\u2019d give anything to feel that way again.\u2019",
    "So Robin and Ramy signed up to work the ball. University College had devised a labour-for-entry scheme for students too poor to afford the ticket price, and Babel students were particularly lucky here, for instead of catering drinks or taking coats, they could work what were called \u2018silver shifts\u2019. This did not take much work other than periodically checking that the bars commissioned to enhance the decorations, lights, and music hadn\u2019t been removed or slipped out of their temporary installations, but the colleges did not seem to know this, and Babel had no good reason to inform them.",
    "On the day of the ball, Robin and Ramy shoved their frock coats and waistcoats into canvas bags and walked past the ticket lines curling around the corner to the kitchen entrance at the back of the college.",
    "University College had outdone itself. It exhausted the eye; there was too much to take in at once \u2013 oysters on enormous pyramids of ice; long tables bearing all kinds of sweet cakes, biscuits, and tarts; champagne flutes going round on precariously balanced plates; and floating fairy lights that pulsed through an array of colours. Stages had been erected overnight in every quad of the college, upon which a variety of harpists, players, and pianists performed.",
    "An opera singer, it was rumoured, had been brought in from Italy to perform in hall; every now and then, Robin thought he could hear her higher notes piercing through the din. Acrobats cavorted on the green, twisting up and down long silken sheets and spinning silver rings around their wrists and ankles. They were dressed in vaguely foreign garb. Robin scrutinized their faces, wondering where they were from.",
    "\u2018You think they\u2019ll run out of oysters?\u2019 Robin asked. He\u2019d never tried them before; they apparently upset Professor Lovell\u2019s stomach, so Mrs Piper never bought them. The gloopy meat and shiny shells looked both disgusting and very enticing. \u2018I just want to know how they taste.\u2019",
    "Ramy disappeared into the crowd. Robin sat atop his ladder and pretended to work. Privately, he was grateful for the job. It was humiliating to wear servant\u2019s blacks while his fellow students danced around him, yes, but it was at least a gentler way to ease into the frenzy of the night. He liked being hidden safely in the corner with something to do with his hands; this way the ball was not quite so overwhelming. And he truly liked discovering what ingenious silver match-pairs Babel had provided for the ball.",
    "One, certainly devised by Professor Lovell, paired the Chinese four-word idiom \u767e\u5349\u5343\u8469 with the English translation \u2018a hundred plants and thousand flowers\u2019. The connotation of the Chinese original, which invoked rich, dazzling, and myriad colours, made the roses redder, the blooming violets larger and more vibrant..",
    "\u2018No oysters,\u2019 said Ramy. \u2018But I brought you some of these truffle things, I don\u2019t know what they are exactly but people kept snagging them off plates.\u2019 He passed a chocolate truffle up the ladder and popped the other one in his mouth. \u2018Oh \u2013 ugh. Never mind. Don\u2019t eat that.\u2019",
    "He meant it. Victoire and Letty were unrecognizable. He\u2019d grown so used to seeing them in shirts and trousers that he forgot sometimes they were women at all. Tonight, he recalled, they were creatures of a different dimension. Letty wore a dress of a pale, floaty blue material that matched her eyes. Her sleeves were quite enormous \u2013 she looked as if she could have concealed an entire leg of mutton up there \u2013 but that appeared to be the fashion of the year, for colourful, billowing sleeves filled the college grounds.",
    "Letty was in fact quite pretty, Robin realized; he\u2019d only never noticed it before \u2013 under the soft fairy lights, her arched eyebrows and her sharply angled jaw did not look cold and austere, but regal and elegant..",
    "It was Victoire, however, who\u2019d truly been transformed. She glowed against the deep emerald fabric of her gown. Her sleeves, too, ballooned outwards, but on her they seemed rather adorable, like a protective ring of clouds. Her hair was twisted into an elegant knot at the top of her head, fastened with two coral pins, and a string of the same coral beads shone like constellations around her neck. She was lovely. She knew it, too; as she took in Robin\u2019s expression a smile bloomed over her face.",
    "\u2018Good party, isn\u2019t it? The opera girl was a little pitchy, but perhaps it was only the acoustics in the chapel \u2013 it\u2019s really not a proper performance venue, you need a bigger space so the sound doesn\u2019t get lost.\u2019 Without looking at her, Colin held his wineglass out in front of Victoire\u2019s face. \u2018Get rid of this and get me a burgundy, will you?\u2019",
    "\u2018Have I?\u2019 Colin really was very drunk; he kept swaying on his feet, and his pale cheeks had turned a deep ruddy colour. The glass hung so precariously from his fingertips that Robin was afraid it would shatter. \u2018Well. They all look the same to me.\u2019",
    "\u2018The waiters are in black, and they\u2019ve got trays,\u2019 Victoire said patiently. Robin was amazed at her restraint; he would have slapped the glass from Colin\u2019s hand. \u2018Though I think you might try some water.\u2019",
    "Colin narrowed his eyes at Victoire, as if trying to see her in better detail. Robin tensed, but Colin only laughed, murmured something under his breath that sounded like the words \u2018She looks like a Tregear,\u2019* and walked off.",
    "\u2018We\u2019re sitting here because we\u2019re already barely tolerated, and because as long as we don\u2019t move too quickly or speak too loudly, we can blend into the background or at least pretend to be serving staff. That\u2019s how this works, Letty. A brown man at an Oxford ball is a fun curiosity as long as he keeps to himself and manages not to offend anyone, but if I dance with you, then someone\u2019s going to hit me, or worse.\u2019",
    "One of the Sharp brothers drifted by just then and extended his hand to Letty. It seemed a rather rude and perfunctory gesture, but Letty took it without comment and left, tossing Ramy a nasty look over her shoulder as she sauntered off.",
    "\u2018Hello, there.\u2019 A red-haired boy in a purple waistcoat swooped upon them. It was Vincy Woolcombe \u2013 the least awful of Pendennis\u2019s friends, Robin recalled. Robin opened his mouth to greet him, but Woolcombe\u2019s eyes slid over him completely; he was solely focused on Victoire. \u2018You\u2019re in our college, aren\u2019t you?\u2019",
    "Robin watched this exchange, impressed. Perhaps Woolcombe was not so terrible after all \u2013 perhaps he was only a prat in association with Pendennis. He, too, wondered briefly if Woolcombe was having fun at Victoire\u2019s expense, but there were no leering friends in sight; no one was glancing surreptitiously over their shoulders and pretending not to laugh.",
    "That left Robin alone with Ramy. Their shifts were ended; the bells had rung for eleven several minutes ago. They both pulled on their dress coats \u2013 identical black garments they\u2019d purchased at the last moment from Ede & Ravenscroft \u2013 but continued lingering in safety by the back wall.",
    "Robin had made a perfunctory attempt to enter the fray, but quickly retreated in horror \u2013 everyone he was vaguely familiar with stood in tight conversational clusters and either ignored him completely as he approached, which made him feel oafish and awkward, or asked him about working at Babel, since that was apparently all they knew about him. Except whenever this happened, he was assaulted with a dozen questions on every side, all having to do with China and the Orient and silver-working.",
    "Ramy, ever loyal, stayed at his side. They watched the proceedings in silence for a bit. Robin snatched a glass of claret from a passing waiter and downed it faster than he should have, just to dull his fear of the noise and the crowd.",
    "Their eyes met. Robin felt a prickle at the back of his neck. The space between them felt very charged, like the moment between lightning and thunder, and Robin had no idea what was going on or what would happen next, only that it all felt very strange and terrifying, like teetering over the edge of a windy, roaring cliff.",
    "Across the quad, Letty and Victoire stood backs against the wall, surrounded on all sides by a pack of leering boys. Pendennis and Woolcombe were among them. Victoire was hugging her arms across her chest, Letty saying something very quickly that they couldn\u2019t make out.",
    "He reached an arm towards her shoulder. Letty drew her hand back and smacked him full across the face. Pendennis recoiled. His face was transformed, beastly with fury. He took a step towards Letty, and for a moment it seemed as if he really might hit her back. Letty flinched away.",
    "Robin had no idea what would happen next. Pendennis was taller, a bit heavier, and likely stronger, but he was swaying on his feet, his gaze unfocused. If this became a fight, it would be a clumsy, undignified one. No one would be seriously hurt. He might even land Pendennis on the ground and skirt away before Pendennis got his wits about him. But the college had strict rules against brawling, there were quite a lot of witnesses, and Robin did not want to know how he would fare against Pendennis\u2019s word before a disciplinary board.",
    "Pendennis sneered, but it was clear the danger had passed. As long as Robin swallowed his pride, as long as he told himself it was only words Pendennis had hurled his way, words that meant nothing at all, he could simply turn and follow Ramy, Victoire, and Letty out of the college unscathed.",
    "\u2018It\u2019s not nothing,\u2019 snapped Letty. \u2018That bastard Thornhill started going on about the different colours of our \u2013 our \u2013 you know, for biological reasons, and then Pendennis decided we ought to show them\u2014\u2019",
    "\u2018They had a go at me too, you know.\u2019 This was a bizarre line of argument, and Robin was not sure why Letty made it at all, but she said it with vehemence. Her voice went up by several octaves. \u2018It wasn\u2019t just because she\u2019s\u2014\u2019",
    "Ramy\u2019s plan, he revealed, was for them to spend the night on Babel\u2019s roof \u2013 just the four of them, a basket of sweets (the kitchens were very easy to steal from if you looked like staff), and the telescope under a clear night sky.* But when they turned the corner on the green, they saw lights and moving silhouettes through the windows of the first floor. Someone was in there.",
    "Fairy lights bobbed all around the lobby, which was crowded with students and graduate fellows. Robin recognized Cathy O\u2019Nell, Vimal Srinivasan, and Ilse Dejima among them. Some danced, some chatted with wineglasses in hands, and some stood with heads bent over worktables dragged down from the eighth floor, watching intently as a graduate fellow etched an engraving into a silver bar. Something went poof, and the room filled with the scent of roses. Everyone cheered.",
    "\u2018You should have invited them,\u2019 said a dark-haired German girl whose name Robin thought might be Minna. She danced in place as she spoke, and her head kept bobbing heavily to the left. \u2018So cruel of you, to let them go to that horror show.\u2019",
    "Glasses were handed round; port was poured. Soon Robin was very pleasantly drunk, head buzzing, limbs floating. He leaned against the shelves, slightly out of breath from waltzing with Victoire, and basked in the marvellousness of it all. Vimal was now on the table, dancing a vigorous jig with Minna. On the opposite table, Matthew Houndslow, winner of that year\u2019s most prestigious postgraduate fellowship, was inscribing a silver bar with a match-pair that caused bright spheres of pink and purple light to bob around the room.",
    "\u2018Ibasho,\u2019 she repeated, swaying. Her arms floated in front of her, either dancing or conducting the music, he couldn\u2019t tell which. For that matter, he couldn\u2019t tell where the music was coming from at all. \u2018It doesn\u2019t translate well into English. It means \u201cwhereabouts\u201d. A place where one feels like home, where they feel like themselves.\u2019",
    "In the months to come, whenever he thought back on this night, he could only grasp a handful of clear memories \u2013 after three glasses of port, it all turned into a pleasant haze. Vaguely he remembered dancing to some frantic Celtic tune on tables pushed together, then playing some kind of language game that mostly involved a lot of shouting and rapid rhyming, and laughing so hard his sides hurt. He remembered Ramy sitting with Victoire in a corner, doing silly impersonations of the professors until her tears were dry, and then until they were both crying from laughter.",
    "He remembered English phrases rising unbidden to his mind as he watched the revels; phrases from songs and poems that he wasn\u2019t quite sure on the meaning of, but which looked and sounded right \u2013 and perhaps that was just what poetry was? Meaning through sound? Through spelling? He couldn\u2019t remember whether he merely thought it, or if he asked it out loud to everyone he came across, but he found himself consumed with the question \u2018What is the light fantastic?\u2019*",
    "\u2018Why won\u2019t he see me?\u2019 And though Robin could think of any number of reasons \u2013 because Ramy was a brown man in England and Letty the daughter of an admiral; because Ramy did not want to be shot in the street; or because Ramy simply did not love her like she loved him, and she\u2019d badly mistaken his general kindness and ostentatious verve for special attention, because Letty was the kind of girl who was used to, and had come to always expect, special attention \u2013 he knew better than to tell her the truth.",
    "What Letty wanted then was not honest counsel, but someone to comfort and love her and give her, if not the attention she craved, then some facsimile of it. So he let her sob against him, soaking the front of his shirt in tears, and rubbed circles in her back as he murmured mindlessly that he didn\u2019t understand \u2013 was Ramy a fool? What wasn\u2019t to love about her? She was gorgeous, gorgeous, she made Aphrodite herself jealous \u2013 indeed, he intoned, she ought to feel lucky she hadn\u2019t been turned into a mayfly already.",
    "He had the oddest feeling of disappearing as he spoke, of fading into the background of a painting depicting a story which must have been old as history. And perhaps it was the drink, but he was fascinated by the way he seemed to drift outside himself, to watch from the awning as her hiccuping sobs and his murmurs mingled, floated, and became puffs of condensation against the cold stained-glass windows.",
    "They were all very drunk by the time the party broke up \u2013 except for Ramy, who was drunk anyway on exhaustion and laughter \u2013 which was the only reason it seemed a good idea to wander through the cemetery behind St Giles, taking the long way round north, to where the girls lived. Ramy murmured a quiet du\u2019a, and they traipsed through the gate. At first it seemed a great adventure as they stumbled against each other, laughing, as they picked their way around the tombstones. But then the air seemed to change very quickly.",
    "The warmth of the streetlamps dimmed; the tombstone shadows stretched long, shifting, as if belying some presence that did not want them there. Robin felt a sudden, chilling dread. It was not illegal to walk through the cemetery, but suddenly it seemed a horrific violation to trespass these grounds in their state..",
    "Suddenly the night air felt icy. The lingering warmth of port had evaporated with their laughter; now they were sober, cold, and very scared. Victoire pulled her shawl tighter around her shoulders. \u2018What do you think happened to her?\u2019",
    "\u2018Probably just something mundane.\u2019 Ramy made a valiant effort to dispel the gloom. \u2018Probably she fell sick, or had an accident, or overexhausted herself. Could be she went skating without a scarf. Could be she got so wrapped up in her research she forgot to eat.\u2019",
    "But Robin suspected Evie Brooke\u2019s death was about more than some mundane bout of illness. Anthony\u2019s disappearance had left hardly a trace on the faculty. Professor Playfair seemed by now to have forgotten he\u2019d ever existed; he\u2019d not uttered a word about Anthony since the day he\u2019d announced his death. Yet he\u2019d kept Evie\u2019s work desk undisturbed for five years and counting.",
    "They must have been in the graveyard for quite some time. The dark sky was slowly giving way to pale light, the chill condensing into morning dew. The ball was over. The last night of term had ended, had given way to endless summer. Wordlessly, they took each other\u2019s hands and walked home.",
    "Robin received his exam marks in his pidge the next morning (Merit in Translation Theory and Latin, Distinction in Etymology, Chinese, and Sanskrit), along with the following note printed on thick, creamy paper: The board of undergraduate studies at the Royal Institute of Translation is pleased to inform you that you have been invited to continue your tenure as undergraduate scholar for the following year.",
    "Only when he had the papers in hand did it all seem real. He\u2019d passed; they\u2019d all passed. For at least another year, they had a home. They had room and board paid for, a steady allowance, and access to all of Oxford\u2019s intellectual riches. They would not be forced to leave Babel. They could breathe easy again.",
    "Oxford in June was hot, sticky, golden, and beautiful. They had no pressing summer assignments \u2013 they could do further research on their independent projects if they liked, though generally, the weeks between the end of Trinity and the start of next Michaelmas were tacitly acknowledged as a reward, and brief respite, that incoming fourth years deserved.",
    "Those were the happiest days of their lives. They had picnics of ripe, bursting grapes; fresh rolls; and Camembert cheese on the hills of South Park. They went punting up and down the Cherwell \u2013 Robin and Ramy got passably good at it, but the girls could not seem to manage the art of pushing them straight ahead instead of sideways into the bank. They walked the seven miles north to Woodstock to tour Blenheim Palace, but did not go in, as the sightseeing fee was exorbitant.",
    "A visiting acting troupe from London put on some excerpts of Shakespeare at the Sheldonian; they were undeniably awful, and the heckling from badly behaved undergraduates probably made them worse, but quality was not the point..",
    "Near the end of June, all anyone could talk about was the coronation of Queen Victoria. Many of the students and fellows still on campus took coaches to Didcot for the train to London the day before, but those who remained in Oxford were treated to a dazzling lighting-up show.",
    "There were rumours of a grand dinner to be put on for Oxford\u2019s poor and homeless, but the city authorities argued that the richness of roast beef and plum pudding would put the poor in such a state of excitement that they would lose their ability to properly enjoy the illumination.* So the poor went hungry that night, but at least the lights were lovely. Robin, Ramy, and Victoire strolled with Letty down High Street with mugs of cold cider in hand, trying to conjure up the same sense of patriotism visible in everyone else..",
    "Near the end of summer they took a weekend trip to London, where they drank in the vitality and variety that Oxford, suspended centuries in the past, so lacked. They went to Drury Lane and saw a show \u2013 the acting wasn\u2019t very good, but the garish make-up and the ingenue\u2019s pitchy warbling kept them fascinated for the full three-hour run time.",
    "They browsed the stalls at New Cut for plump strawberries, copper trinkets, and sachets of supposedly exotic teas; tossed pennies to dancing monkeys and organ-grinders; dodged beckoning prostitutes; perused street stands of counterfeit silver bars with amusement;* had dinner at an \u2018Authentick Indian\u2019 curry house that disappointed Ramy but satisfied the rest of them; and slept overnight in a single crowded townhouse room on Doughty Street. Robin and Ramy lay on the floor swaddled in coats while the girls huddled on the narrow bed, all of them giggling and whispering until long past midnight..",
    "The next day they took a walking tour of the city that ended by the Port of London, where they strolled down to the docks and marvelled at the massive ships, their great white sails, and the complex interlacing of their masts and rigging. They tried identifying the flags and company logos of the departing vessels, speculating on where they might be coming from or going. Greece? Canada? Sweden? Portugal?",
    "Every graduating cohort at Babel went on a grand, fully compensated international voyage at the conclusion of fourth-year exams. These voyages usually corresponded with some Babel business \u2013 graduates had served as live interpreters at the court of Nicholas I, hunted for cuneiform tablets in the ruins of Mesopotamia, and once, accidentally, caused a near diplomatic breakdown in Paris \u2013 but they were primarily a chance for the graduates to simply see the world, and to soak in the foreign linguistic environments they had been sequestered from during their years of study.",
    "Ramy was convinced their class would be sent to either China or India. \u2018There\u2019s simply so much happening. The East India Company\u2019s lost its monopoly in Canton, which means they\u2019ll need translators for all kinds of business reorientations. I\u2019d give my left arm for it to be Calcutta. You\u2019ll love it \u2013 we\u2019ll go and stay with my family for a bit; I\u2019ve written to them all about you, they even know Letty can\u2019t take her tea too hot. Or perhaps we\u2019ll go to Canton \u2013 wouldn\u2019t that be lovely, Birdie? When\u2019s the last time you were home?\u2019",
    "Robin wasn\u2019t sure he wanted to return to Canton. He\u2019d considered it a few times, but couldn\u2019t summon any feelings of excitement, only a confused, vaguely guilty dread. Nothing awaited him there; no friends, no family, just a city he only half remembered. Rather, he was afraid of how he might react if he did go home; if he stepped back into the world of a forgotten childhood. What if, upon return, he couldn\u2019t bring himself to leave?",
    "\u2018I\u2019m not sure they\u2019ll be mutually intelligible,\u2019 said Victoire. \u2018They\u2019re both French-based, of course, but Krey\u00f2l takes grammar cues from the Fon language, while Mauritian Creole . . . hm. I don\u2019t know. There\u2019s no Grammatica, so I\u2019ve nothing to consult.\u2019",
    "The happiest development of that summer was that Victoire and Letty had gone back to being friends. In fact, all the strange, ill-defined awfulness of their third year had evaporated with the news that they\u2019d passed their exams. Letty no longer grated on Robin\u2019s nerves, and Ramy no longer made Letty scowl every time he opened his mouth.",
    "To be fair, their fights were tabled rather than resolved. They had not really confronted the reasons why they\u2019d fallen out, but they were all willing to blame it on stress. There would be a time when they had to face up to their very real differences, when they would hash things out instead of always changing the subject, but for now they were content to enjoy the summer and to remember again what it was like to love one another.",
    "For these, truly, were the last of the golden days. That summer felt all the more precious because they all knew it couldn\u2019t last, that such delights were only so because of the endless, exhausting nights that had earned them. Soon year four would start, then graduating exams, and then work. None of them knew what life might look like after that, but surely they could not remain a cohort forever. Surely, eventually, they had to leave the city of dreaming spires; had to take up their respective posts and repay all that Babel had given them.",
    "In January of 1838, the inventor Samuel Morse had given a demonstration in Morristown, New Jersey, showing off a device that could transmit messages over long distances using electrical impulses to convey a series of dots and dashes. Sceptical, the United States Congress declined to grant him funding to build a line connecting the capitol in Washington, DC, with other cities, and would drag their feet in doing so for another five years.",
    "But scholars at the Royal Institute of Translation, as soon as they heard that Morse\u2019s device worked, went overseas and cajoled Morse into making a months-long visit to Oxford, where the silver-working department was amazed that this device required no match-pairs to work, but instead ran on pure electricity. By July 1839, Babel hosted the first working telegraph line in England, which was connected to the British Foreign Office in London.*.",
    "Morse\u2019s original code transmitted only numerals, under the assumption that the receiver could look up the corresponding words in a guidebook. This was fine for conversations that involved a limited vocabulary \u2013 train signals, weather reports, and certain kinds of military communications. But soon after Morse\u2019s arrival, Professors De Vreese and Playfair developed an alphanumeric code that allowed exchange of messages of any kind.* This expanded the telegraph\u2019s possible uses to the commercial, personal, and beyond.",
    "Word spread quickly that Babel had means of communicating instantaneously with London from Oxford. Soon clients \u2013 largely businessmen, government officials, and the occasional clergyman \u2013 were crammed in the lobby and lined up around the block clutching messages they needed sent. Professor Lovell, exasperated by the clamour, wanted to set the defensive wards on crowd. But calmer, more financially attuned heads prevailed.",
    "The next obstacle was staffing the office with operators. Students were the obvious source of free labour, and so every Babel undergraduate and graduate fellow was required to learn Morse code. This took only a matter of days, since Morse code was the rare language that did in fact have a perfect one-to-one correlation between language symbols, provided one was communicating in English. When September bled into October and Michaelmas term began that autumn, all students on campus were assigned to work at least one three-hour shift a week.",
    "And so, at nine o\u2019clock every Sunday night, Robin dragged himself to the little lobby office and sat by the telegraph machine with a stack of course readings, waiting for the needle to buzz into life..",
    "The advantage of the late shift was that the tower received very little correspondence during those hours, since everyone in the London office would have already gone home. All Robin had to do was stay awake from nine to midnight, in case any urgent missives arrived. Otherwise, he was free to do as he liked, and he usually spent these hours reading or revising his compositions for the next morning\u2019s class.",
    "Occasionally he glanced out of the window, squinting across the quad to relieve the strain of the dim light on his eyes. The green was usually empty. High Street, so busy during the day, was eerie late at night; when the sun had gone down, when all the light came from pale streetlamps or from candles inside windows, it looked like another, parallel Oxford, an Oxford of the faerie realm.",
    "On cloudless nights especially, Oxford was transformed, its streets clear, its stones silent, its spires and turrets promising riddles and adventures and a world of abstraction in which one could get lost forever..",
    "Robin sat frozen at his desk, unsure what to do. They were here on Hermes business. They had to be. Nothing else explained the attire; the furtive glances; the late night trip to the tower when Robin knew they had no business being there, because he\u2019d seen them finish their papers for Professor Craft\u2019s seminar on the floor of Ramy\u2019s room just several hours before.",
    "Of course he wouldn\u2019t report them \u2013 that was not in question. But should he help them? No, perhaps not \u2013 the tower was not wholly empty; there were researchers still on the eighth floor, and if he startled Ramy and Victoire, he might attract unwanted attention. The only choice seemed to be to do nothing. If he pretended never to notice, and if they succeeded in whatever it was they wanted, then the fragile equilibrium of their lives at Babel would not be disturbed. Then they could maintain the thin veneer of deniability Robin had lived with for years.",
    "Ramy and Victoire slipped through the door and up the stairs. Robin trained his eyes on his translation, trying not to strain his ear for any hint of what they might be doing. Ten minutes later, he heard descending footsteps. They\u2019d got what they\u2019d come for. Soon they\u2019d be back out the door. Then the moment would pass, and the calm would resume, and Robin could consign this to the back of his mind with all the other unpleasant truths he hadn\u2019t the will to untangle\u2014",
    "Ramy and Victoire were trapped just outside the front door, ensnared in a web of glistening silvery string that doubled and multiplied before his eyes, new strands lashing around their wrists, waists, ankles, and throats with every passing second. A smattering of items lay scattered at their feet \u2013 six silver bars, two old books, one engraving stylus. Items Babel scholars regularly took home at the end of the day.",
    "Except, it appeared, Professor Playfair had successfully changed the wards. He\u2019d achieved even more than Robin had feared \u2013 he\u2019d altered them to detect not only which people and things were passing through, but whether their purposes were legitimate.",
    "\u2018Hold still.\u2019 Robin yanked at the strands. They were sticky but pliable, breakable; impossible to escape alone but not without help. He freed Ramy\u2019s neck and hands first, then together they pulled Victoire out of the web, though Robin\u2019s legs became entangled in the process. The web, it seemed, gave only if it could take. But its vicious lashing had ceased; whatever match-pair triggered the alarm seemed to have calmed. Ramy pulled his ankles free and stepped back. For a moment they all regarded each other under the moonlight, baffled.",
    "\u2018There\u2019s no time,\u2019 said Robin. He couldn\u2019t move his legs. The strings had ceased multiplying \u2013 perhaps because Robin was not the thief \u2013 but the web was now impossibly dense, stretching across the entire front entrance, and if Ramy came any closer, he feared, they\u2019d both be trapped. \u2018Leave me.\u2019",
    "\u2018It\u2019s not obvious, so don\u2019t tell me,\u2019 Robin hissed. The siren\u2019s wailing was endless; soon the police would be at the green. \u2018Say nothing. I know nothing, and when they question me, that\u2019s what I\u2019ll say. Just hurry and go, please, I\u2019ll think of something.\u2019",
    "Ramy opened his mouth, closed it, then bent down to scoop up the stolen materials. Victoire followed suit. They left just two bars behind \u2013 clever, Robin thought, for that was some evidence that Robin had been working alone, that he had no accomplices who\u2019d disappeared with all the contraband. Then they dashed down the steps, across the green and into the alley.",
    "\u2018Who\u2019s there?\u2019 someone shouted. Robin saw lamps bobbing at the other end of the quadrangle. He twisted his head and squinted towards Broad Street, trying and failing to glimpse any trace of his friends. They\u2019d got away, it had worked, the police were coming only for the tower. Only for him.",
    "Angry shouts, bright lamps in his face, firm hands on his arms. Robin hardly processed what happened over the next several minutes; he was aware only of his vague, incoherent rambles, a cacophony of policemen yelling different orders and questions in his ear. He tried piecing together an excuse, some story about seeing thieves caught in the webbing, and how they\u2019d snagged him when he went to stop them, but that was incoherent upon utterance, and the police only laughed.",
    "Eventually they prised him free of the web and led him back into the tower to a small, windowless room in the lobby, empty save for a single chair. The door had a small grate at eye level covered by a sliding flap; it resembled a jail cell more than a reading room. He wondered if he was not the first Hermes operative to be detained here. He wondered if the faint brown splotch in the corner might be dried blood..",
    "They locked the door and left. They had not said which professor, or when they would return. Not knowing was torture. Robin sat and waited, knees jangling, arms shuddering miserably from waves and waves of nauseating adrenaline.",
    "He was finished. There was, surely, no coming back from this. It was so difficult to be expelled from Babel, which invested so much in its hard-sought talent that previous Babel undergraduates had been pardoned for almost every kind of offence save for murder.* But surely thievery and treason were grounds for expulsion. And then what? A cell in the city gaol? In Newgate? Would they hang him? Or would he simply be put on a ship and sent back to where he had come from, where he had no friends, no family, and no prospects?",
    "An image rose in his mind, one he had locked away for nearly a decade now \u2013 a hot, airless room, the smell of sick, his mother lying stiff beside him, her drawn cheeks turning blue before his eyes. The last ten years \u2013 Hampstead, Oxford, Babel \u2013 had all been a miraculous enchantment, but he had broken the rules \u2013 had broken the spell \u2013 and soon the glamour would fall away and he would be back among the poor, the sick, the dying, the dead.",
    "It was Professor Lovell. Robin searched his eyes for a shred of something \u2013 kindness, disappointment, or anger \u2013 anything that might prophesy what he should expect. But his father\u2019s expression, as ever before, was only a blank, inscrutable mask. \u2018Good morning.\u2019",
    "\u2018Have a seat.\u2019 The first thing Professor Lovell had done was unlock Robin\u2019s cuffs. Then he\u2019d led him up the stairs to his office on the seventh floor, where now they sat facing each other as casually as if convening for a weekly tutorial.",
    "\u2018You\u2019re very lucky the police contacted me first. Imagine if they\u2019d found Jerome instead. You\u2019d be missing your legs right now.\u2019 Professor Lovell leaned forward, hands clasped over his desk. \u2018How long have you been pilfering resources for the Hermes Society?\u2019",
    "Robin blanched. He had not expected Professor Lovell to be so direct. This question was very dangerous. Professor Lovell evidently knew about Hermes. But how much did he know? How much could Robin lie about? Perhaps he was bluffing, and perhaps Robin could fumble his way out of this if he minced his words in just the right way.",
    "Robin clamped his mouth shut. It didn\u2019t matter. He didn\u2019t know what he would have said. There was no explaining himself out of this mess, no possible exoneration. He could only face up to the stark evidence of his betrayal and await the consequences. But if he could keep Ramy and Victoire\u2019s names out of this, if he could convince Professor Lovell that he\u2019d acted alone, that would be enough.",
    "He leaned back, shook his head. \u2018I have done more for you than you could ever imagine. You were a dock boy in Canton. Your mother was an outcast. Even if your father had been Chinese,\u2019 Professor Lovell\u2019s throat pulsed then, and this was as much of an admission as he would ever make, Robin knew, \u2018your station would have been the same. You would have scraped along for pennies your entire life. You never would have seen the shores of England. You never would have read Horace, Homer, or Thucydides \u2013 you never would have opened a book, for that matter.",
    "\u2018Do you know how privileged you\u2019ve been by this university?\u2019 Professor Lovell\u2019s voice remained unchanged in volume, but each syllable grew longer, first drawled and then spat out as if he were biting the words off at the ends. \u2018Do you know how much most households pay to send their sons to Oxford? You enjoy rooms and lodging at no cost. You\u2019re blessed with a monthly allowance. You have access to the largest stores of knowledge in the world. Did you think your situation was common?\u2019",
    "A hundred arguments swam through Robin\u2019s head \u2013 that he had not requested these privileges of Oxford, had not chosen to be spirited out of Canton at all, that the generosities of the university should not demand his constant, unswerving loyalty to the Crown and its colonial projects, and if it did, then that was a peculiar form of bondage he had never agreed to. That he had not wished for this fate until it was thrust upon him, decided for him. That he didn\u2019t know what life he would have chosen \u2013 this one, or a life in which he\u2019d grown up in Canton, among people who looked and spoke like him.",
    "\u2018Was it fun for you?\u2019 Professor Lovell\u2019s lip curled. \u2018Did you get a thrill out of it? Oh, you must have. I imagine you considered yourself the hero of one of your little stories \u2013 a regular Dick Turpin, didn\u2019t you? You always did love your penny dreadfuls. A weary student by day, and a dashing thief by night? Was it romantic, Robin Swift?\u2019",
    "\u2018No, Robin. Tell me what you were fighting for.\u2019 Professor Lovell leaned back, steepled his fingers together, and nodded. As if this were an examination. As if he were really listening. \u2018Go, on, convince me. Try to recruit me. Do your very best.\u2019",
    "\u2018It\u2019s not right,\u2019 Robin continued angrily. \u2018It\u2019s selfish. All our silver goes to luxury, to the military, to making lace and weapons when there are people dying of simple things these bars could fix. It\u2019s not right that you recruit students from other countries to work your translation centre and that their motherlands receive nothing in return.\u2019",
    "He knew these arguments well. He was parroting what Griffin had told him, truths he had come to internalize. Yet in the face of Professor Lovell\u2019s stony silence, it all seemed so silly. His voice sounded frail and tinny, desperately unsure of itself.",
    "\u2018You drink the champagne, Robin. You take your allowance. You live in your furnished room on Magpie Lane, you parade down the streets in your robes and tailored clothes, all paid for by the school, and yet you say all this money comes from blood. This does not bother you?\u2019",
    "And that was the heart of it all, wasn\u2019t it? Robin had always been willing, in theory, to give up only some things for a revolution he halfway believed in. He was fine with resistance as long as it didn\u2019t hurt him. And the contradiction was fine, as long as he didn\u2019t think too hard about it, or look too closely. But spelled out like this, in such bleak terms, it seemed inarguable that far from being a revolutionary, Robin, in fact, had no convictions whatsoever.",
    "\u2018And are we obligated to distribute silver bars all around the world to backward countries who have had every opportunity to construct their own centres of translation? It takes no great investment to study foreign languages. Why must it be Britain\u2019s problem if other nations fail to take advantage of what they have?\u2019",
    "Robin opened his mouth to reply, but could think of nothing to say. Why was it so difficult to find the words? There was something wrong with this argument, but once again, he could not figure out what. Free trade, open borders, equal access to the same knowledge \u2013 it all sounded so fine in theory. But if the playing field really was so even, why had all the profits accumulated in Britain? Were the British really so much more clever and industrious? Had they simply played the game, fair and square, and won?",
    "\u2018Of course. Griffin.\u2019 Professor Lovell spat the name like a curse. He watched Robin for a long moment, scrutinizing his face as if he could find the ghost of his elder son in the younger. Then he asked, in a strangely soft tone, \u2018Do you know what happened to Eveline Brooke?\u2019",
    "\u2018No,\u2019 Robin said, even as he thought yes; he did know, not the particulars of the story but its general outline. He had nearly put it all together by now, though he\u2019d held off sliding in the final piece, because he did not want to know, and did not want it to be true.",
    "\u2018He never told you? I\u2019m surprised, to be honest. I would have expected him to gloat.\u2019 Professor Lovell\u2019s eyes were very dark. \u2018Then let me enlighten you. Five years ago, Evie \u2013 poor, innocent Evie \u2013 was working on the eighth floor after midnight. She\u2019d kept her lamp on, but she hadn\u2019t realized the rest of the lights were off. That\u2019s how Evie was. When she was caught up in her work, she lost track of what was going on around her. Nothing existed for her but the research.",
    "\u2018Griffin Harley entered the tower at about two in the morning. He didn\u2019t see Evie \u2013 she was working in the back corner behind the workstations. He thought he was alone. And Griffin proceeded to do what Griffin does best \u2013 pilfer and steal, root through precious manuscripts to smuggle them to God knows where. He was nearly at the door when he realized Evie had seen him.\u2019",
    "Professor Lovell fell silent. Robin was confused by this pause, until he saw, to his astonishment, that his eyes were red and wet at the corners. Professor Lovell, who\u2019d never shown the slightest ounce of feeling in all the years Robin had known him, was crying.",
    "\u2018She never did anything.\u2019 His voice was hoarse. \u2018She didn\u2019t raise the alarm. She didn\u2019t scream. She never had the chance. Eveline Brooke was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. But Griffin was so afraid she might turn him in that he killed her anyway. I found her the next morning.\u2019",
    "He reached out and tapped the worn silver bar lying at the corner of his desk. Robin had seen it many times before, but Professor Lovell had always kept it turned away, half-hidden behind a picture frame, and he\u2019d never been bold enough to ask. Professor Lovell flipped it over. \u2018Do you know what this match-pair does?\u2019",
    "\u2018B\u00e0o,\u2019 said Professor Lovell. \u2018The radical for fire. And beside it, the radical for violence, cruelty, and turbulence; the same radical which on its own can mean untamed, savage brutality; the same radical used in the words for thunder and cruelty.* And he translated it against burst, the tamest English translation possible, so tame that it hardly translates as such at all \u2013 so that all of that force, that destruction, was trapped in the silver. It exploded against her chest. Sprang her ribs apart like an open birdcage.",
    "And then he left her there, lying among the shelves, books still in hand. When I saw her, her blood had pooled across half the floor. Stained every page red.\u2019 He slid the bar across the table. \u2018Hold it.\u2019.",
    "Robin reached out and closed his fingers around the bar. It was terribly cold to the touch, colder than any other silver he\u2019d encountered, and inordinately heavy. Yes, he could believe that this bar had murdered someone. It seemed to hum with trapped, furious potential, a lit grenade, waiting to go off.",
    "But wasn\u2019t he? Griffin, who spoke of Babel faculty as if they were enemy combatants, who sent his own brother repeatedly into the fray without care for the consequences, who was so convinced of the Manichaean justice of the war he fought that he could see little else. Wouldn\u2019t Griffin have murdered a defenceless girl, if it meant keeping Hermes secure?",
    "\u2018This is who you\u2019ve thrown your lot in with,\u2019 said Professor Lovell. \u2018A liar and a killer. Do you imagine you\u2019re aiding some movement of global liberation, Robin? Don\u2019t be naive. You\u2019re aiding Griffin\u2019s delusions of grandeur. And for what?\u2019 He nodded to Robin\u2019s shoulder. \u2018A bullet in your arm?\u2019",
    "\u2018Professor Playfair observed you might have hurt your arm rowing. I am not quite so easily deceived.\u2019 Professor Lovell clasped his hands over the desk and leaned back. \u2018So. The choice ought to be very obvious, I think. Babel, or Hermes.\u2019",
    "\u2018It\u2019s not quite so easy to leave Babel, I\u2019m afraid. You\u2019ve strayed down the wrong path, but I believe it was as a result of vicious influences \u2013 influences crueller and wilier than you could have been expected to handle. You\u2019re naive, yes. And a disappointment. But you\u2019re not finished. This does not need to end with gaol or prison.\u2019 Professor Lovell tapped his fingers against the desk. \u2018But it would be very helpful if you could give us something useful.\u2019",
    "Robin flinched. Those were precisely the same words Griffin had used; he remembered. And Griffin had said it exactly the same way Professor Lovell did now, cold and imperious, as if he\u2019d already won the argument, as if any response Robin made was bound to be nonsense.",
    "And Robin could imagine Griffin\u2019s smirk just now; knew exactly what he would say \u2013 of course you\u2019ll choose your creature comforts, you coddled little scholar. But what right did Griffin have to judge his choices? Staying at Babel, at Oxford, wasn\u2019t indulgence; it was survival. It was his only ticket into this country, the one thing between him and the streets.",
    "He felt a sudden flare of hatred towards Griffin. Robin had asked for none of this, and now his future \u2013 and Ramy\u2019s and Victoire\u2019s futures \u2013 hung in the balance. And where was Griffin? Where was he when Robin had been shot? Vanished. He\u2019d used them to do his bidding, then abandoned them when things went sour. At least if Griffin went to prison, he deserved it.",
    "\u2018If it\u2019s loyalty that\u2019s keeping you quiet, then there\u2019s nothing else to be done,\u2019 said Professor Lovell. \u2018But I think we can work together still. I think you\u2019re not quite ready to leave Babel. Don\u2019t you?\u2019",
    "In the days and weeks that followed he would try to persuade himself that this was a moment of strategic concession, not of betrayal. That he was not giving up much of importance \u2013 Griffin himself had said they had multiple safe houses, hadn\u2019t he? \u2013 and that this way Ramy and Victoire were protected, he was not expelled, and all the lines of communication existed still for some future cooperation with Hermes. But he\u2019d never quite talk himself out of the nasty truth \u2013 that this was not about Hermes, nor about Ramy or Victoire, but about self-preservation.",
    "\u2018I know you\u2019re better than this.\u2019 He leaned forward over his desk. \u2018You are unlike Griffin in every way possible. You\u2019re humble, you\u2019re bright, and you work hard. You are less corrupted by your heritage than he was. If I\u2019d only just met you, I\u2019d be hard pressed to guess you were a Chinaman at all. You have prodigious talent, and talent deserves a second chance. But careful, boy.\u2019 He gestured to the door. \u2018There won\u2019t be a third.\u2019",
    "Robin stood up, then glanced down at his hand. He noticed he\u2019d been clutching the bar that had killed Evie Brooke this whole time. It felt simultaneously very hot and very cold, and he had the strange fear that if he touched it for a moment longer, it might erode a hole through his palm. He held it out. \u2018Here, sir\u2014\u2019",
    "\u2018I have been staring at that bar every day for the past five years, wondering where I went wrong with Griffin. If I had raised him differently, or seen him earlier for what he was, if Evie would still \u2013 but never mind.\u2019 Professor Lovell\u2019s voice hardened. \u2018Now it weighs on your conscience. Keep it, Robin Swift. Carry it in your front pocket. Pull it out whenever you begin to doubt, and let it remind you which side are the villains.\u2019",
    "He motioned for Robin to leave the office. Robin stumbled down the stairs, the silver clutched tight in his fingers, dazed and quite sure he\u2019d pushed his entire world off course. Only he hadn\u2019t the faintest clue whether he\u2019d done the right thing, what right and wrong meant at all, or how the pieces might now fall.",
    "Ramiz Rafi Mirza had always been a clever boy. He had a prodigious memory, the gift of the gab. He soaked up languages like a sponge, and he had an uncanny ear for rhythm and sound. He did not merely repeat the phrases he absorbed; he uttered them in such precise imitation of the original speaker, investing his words with all their intended emotion, it was like he momentarily became them. In another life, he would have been destined for the stage. He had that ineffable skill, of making simple words sing.",
    "Ramy was brilliant, and he had ample opportunity to show off. The Mirza family had navigated the vicissitudes of that era with great fortune. Although they were among the Muslim families who had lost land and holdings after the Permanent Settlement, the Mirzas had found steady, if not very lucrative, employment in the household of one Mr Horace Hayman Wilson, secretary of the Asiatic Society of Bengal in Calcutta.",
    "So Ramy grew up among the elite English families of Calcutta\u2019s white town, among porticoed and colonnaded houses built in European styles and shops catering exclusively to a European clientele. Wilson took an early interest in his education, and while other boys his age were still playing in the streets, Ramy was auditing classes at the Mohammedan College of Calcutta, where he learned arithmetic, theology, and philosophy. Arabic, Persian, and Urdu he studied with his father. Latin and Greek he learned from tutors hired by Wilson. English he absorbed from the world around him.",
    "In the Wilson household, they called him the little professor. Blessed Ramy, dazzling Ramy. He had no idea what the purpose was of anything he studied, only that it delighted the adults so when he mastered it all. Often, he performed tricks for the guests Sir Horace had over to his sitting room. They would show him a series of playing cards, and he\u2019d repeat with perfect accuracy the suit and number of the cards in the order in which they\u2019d appeared.",
    "He once took pride in this. He liked hearing the guests\u2019 shouts of wonder, liked the way they ruffled his hair and pressed sweets into his palm before they bade him scamper off to the kitchens. He had no understanding of class then, or of race. He thought it was all a game. He did not see his father watching from around the corner, eyebrows knitted with worry. He did not know that impressing a white man could be as dangerous as provoking one.",
    "Sir Horace did not tell Ramy not to, so Ramy hurried to Mr Trevelyan\u2019s side and stood straight, hands clasped behind his back like a little soldier. He\u2019d learned that English guests adored this stance; they found it precious. \u2018Yes, sir?\u2019",
    "Ramy complied. Gratified chuckles around the room. Ramy decided to test his luck. \u2018Little numbers are for little children,\u2019 he said in perfect English. \u2018If you\u2019d like to converse about algebra, pick a language and we\u2019ll do that too.\u2019",
    "Mr Trevelyan turned back to the other guests. \u2018Consider this boy and his father. Both of similar ability, both of a similar background and education. The father begins with even more of an advantage, I would say, as his father, I\u2019m told, belonged to a wealthier merchant class. But so fortunes rise and fall. Despite his natural talents, Mr Mirza here can attain no better than a posting as a domestic servant. Don\u2019t you agree, Mr Mirza?\u2019",
    "Ramy stared at his father; the man he still thought was as tall as a mountain, the man who had taught him all his scripts: Roman, Arabic, and Nastaliq. The man who taught him salah. The man who taught him the meaning of respect. His hafiz.",
    "\u2018Well, there you go,\u2019 said Mr Trevelyan. \u2018You see, Horace, these people have ambitions. They have the intellect, and the desire to self-govern, as so they should.* And it\u2019s your educational policies that are keeping them down. India simply has no languages for statecraft. Your poems and epics are all very interesting, to be sure, but on the matters of administration\u2014\u2019",
    "Two years later, in 1833, Sir Horace Wilson left Calcutta to take on the position of the first Chair of Sanskrit at Oxford University.* Mr and Mrs Mirza knew better than to protest when Wilson proposed to bring their son with him to England, and Ramy did not begrudge his parents for not fighting to keep him at their side. (He knew, by then, how dangerous it was to defy a white man.)",
    "\u2018My staff will raise him up in Yorkshire,\u2019 Wilson explained. \u2018I will visit him when I can take leave from the university. Then, when he\u2019s grown, I\u2019ll have him enrolled at University College. Charles Trevelyan might be right, and English might be the path forward for the natives, but there\u2019s value yet in Indian languages where scholars are concerned. English is good enough for those chaps in civil administration, but we need our real geniuses studying Persian and Arabic, don\u2019t we? Someone\u2019s got to keep the ancient traditions alive.\u2019",
    "His father stood a little way back, observing his wife and children, blinking hard as if trying to commit everything to memory. At last, when the boarding call sounded, he hugged his son to his chest and whispered, \u2018Allah hafiz.* Write to your mother.\u2019",
    "Ramy was fourteen then, and old enough to understand the meaning of pride. Ramy intended to do more than remember. For he understood now why his father had smiled that day in the sitting room \u2013 not out of weakness or submission, and not out of fear of reprisal. He\u2019d been playing a part. He\u2019d been showing Ramy how it was done.",
    "Lie, Ramiz. This was the lesson, the most important lesson he\u2019d ever been taught. Hide, Ramiz. Show the world what they want; contort yourself into the image they want to see, because seizing control of the story is how you in turn control them. Hide your faith, hide your prayers, for Allah will still know your heart.",
    "And what an act Ramy put on. He had no trouble navigating English high society \u2013 Calcutta had its fair share of English taverns, music halls, and theatres, and what he saw in Yorkshire was no more than an expansion of the elite microcosm he\u2019d grown up in. He thickened and thinned his accent depending on his audience. He learned all the fanciful notions the English held about his people, elaborated on them like an expert playwright, and spat them back out. He knew when to play a lascar, a houseboy, a prince. He learned when to flatter and when to engage in self-deprecation.",
    "He could have written a thesis on white pride, on white curiosity. He knew how to make himself an object of fascination while neutralizing himself as a threat. He fine-tuned the greatest of all tricks, which was to swindle an Englishman into looking at him with respect..",
    "He grew so good at this that he almost began to lose himself in the artifice. A dangerous trap indeed, for a player to believe his own stories, to be blinded by the applause. He could envision himself as a postgraduate fellow, dripping with distinctions and awards. A richly paid solicitor on Legal. A highly acclaimed spontaneous interpreter, sailing back and forth between London and Calcutta, bringing riches and gifts for his family every time he returned.",
    "And this scared him sometimes, how easily he danced around Oxford, how attainable this imagined future seemed. Outside, he dazzled. Inside, he felt like a fraud, a traitor. And he was just starting to despair, to wonder if all he would ever accomplish was to become a lackey of empire as Wilson had intended, for the avenues of anticolonial resistance seemed so few, and so hopeless.",
    "It appears quite certain that the Chinese, a money-making and money-loving people, are as much addicted to trade, and as anxious as any nation on earth to court a commercial intercourse with strangers.",
    "Morning came. Robin rose, washed, and dressed for class. He met Ramy outside the house. Neither said a word; they walked in silence to the tower door, which, despite Robin\u2019s sudden fear, opened to let them in. They were late; Professor Craft was already lecturing when they took their seats. Letty shot them an irritated glare. Victoire gave Robin a nod, her face inscrutable. Professor Craft continued as if she hadn\u2019t seen them; this was how she always dealt with tardiness. They pulled out their pens and began taking down notes on Tacitus and his thorny ablative absolutes.",
    "The room seemed at once both mundane and heartbreakingly beautiful: the morning light streaming through stained-glass windows, casting colourful patterns on the polished wooden desks; the clean scratch of chalk against the blackboard; and the sweet, woody smell of old books. A dream; this was an impossible dream, this fragile, lovely world in which, for the price of his convictions, he had been allowed to remain.",
    "That afternoon they received notices in their pidges to prepare to depart for Canton by way of London by the eleventh of October \u2013 the day after next. They would spend three weeks in China \u2013 two in Canton, and one in Macau \u2013 and then stop in Mauritius for ten days on the way home.",
    "\u2018It explains here.\u2019 Ramy tapped the bottom of the page. \u2018Special circumstances in Canton \u2013 they\u2019re short on Chinese translators and want Babblers to fill in the gap, so they\u2019ve pushed our voyage up ahead.\u2019",
    "Robin, Ramy, and Victoire exchanged glances with one another. They all shared the same suspicion \u2013 that this sudden departure was somehow linked to Friday night. But they couldn\u2019t know what that meant for Ramy\u2019s and Victoire\u2019s presumed innocence, or what this voyage held in store for them all.",
    "The final day before they left was torture. The only one among them who felt any excitement was Letty, who took it upon herself to march into their rooms that night and make sure their trunks were properly packed. \u2018You don\u2019t realize how cold it gets at sea in the mornings,\u2019 she said, folding Ramy\u2019s shirts into a neat pile on his bed. \u2018You\u2019ll need more than just a linen shirt, Ramy, you\u2019ll want two layers at least.\u2019",
    "\u2018Well, I\u2019ve travelled regularly,\u2019 she said, ignoring him. \u2018I ought to know. And we should keep a little bag of remedies \u2013 sleeping tinctures, ginger \u2013 I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s time to run to a shop, we might have to do so in London\u2014\u2019",
    "Letty turned stiffly to sort through Robin\u2019s trunk. Victoire cast Robin and Ramy a helpless look. They couldn\u2019t speak freely in Letty\u2019s presence, so they could only sit simmering in anxiety. The same unanswered questions bedevilled them all. What was happening? Had they been forgiven, or was the axe still waiting to drop? Would they naively board the ship to Canton, only to be abandoned on the other side?",
    "Most importantly \u2013 how was it possible they\u2019d been recruited separately to the Hermes Society without knowledge of the others? Ramy and Victoire at least had some excuse \u2013 they were new to Hermes; they might have been too frightened by the society\u2019s demands for silence to say anything to Robin yet. But Robin had known about Hermes for three years now, and he\u2019d never spoken of it once, not even to Ramy. He\u2019d done a marvellous job hiding his greatest secret from friends who, he\u2019d proclaimed, owned his heart.",
    "They headed to London the next afternoon with Professor Lovell, who was to be their supervisor throughout the voyage. The trip was, thankfully, much shorter than the ten-hour stagecoach ride that had brought Robin to Oxford three years ago. The railway line between Oxford and Paddington Station had finally been completed over the previous summer, its opening commemorated with the installation of silver bars under the platform of the newly constructed Oxford Station,* and so the journey took them only an hour and a half, during which Robin managed not to meet Professor Lovell\u2019s eyes once.",
    "Their ship did not depart until tomorrow; they would lodge overnight at an inn on New Bond Street. Letty insisted they go out and explore London for a bit, so they ended up going to see the sitting room show of someone who called herself Princess Caraboo. Princess Caraboo was notorious among Babel students. Once a humble cobbler\u2019s daughter, she had persuaded several people into believing she was exotic royalty from the island of Javasu.",
    "But it was now nearly a decade since Princess Caraboo had been unmasked as Mary Willcocks of North Devon, and her show \u2013 which consisted of a strange hopping dance, several very emphatic utterances in a made-up tongue, and prayers to a god she called Allah-Tallah (here Ramy wrinkled his nose), came off as more pathetic than funny. The display put a bad taste in their mouths; they left early and returned to the inn, tired and laconic..",
    "The next morning, they boarded an East India Company clipper named the Merope heading straight for Canton. These ships were built for speed, for they had to ferry perishable goods back and forth as quickly as possible, and were thus fitted out with state-of-the-art silver bars to hasten their voyage. Robin vaguely remembered that his first journey from Canton to London, ten years ago, had taken close to four months. These clippers could make that journey a mere six weeks.",
    "Robin wasn\u2019t sure. He\u2019d felt funny ever since they\u2019d boarded, though he couldn\u2019t quite give a name to his discomfort. It didn\u2019t seem real that he was headed back. Ten years ago he\u2019d been thrilled as he sailed towards London, head spinning with dreams of the world on the other side of the ocean. This time, he thought he knew what to expect. That scared him. He imagined his homecoming with a dreadful anticipation; the fear of not knowing one\u2019s own mother in a crowd.",
    "Would he recognize what he saw? Would he remember it at all? At the same time, the prospect of seeing Canton again seemed so sudden and unbelievable; he found himself with the strange conviction that by the time they reached it, it would have disappeared clean off the globe..",
    "Still more frightening was the possibility that once he arrived, he\u2019d be made to stay; that Lovell had lied and this whole trip was contrived to get him out of England; that he would be exiled from Oxford, and all that he knew, forever.",
    "Meanwhile, there were six weeks at sea to suffer through. These proved torturous from the start. Ramy and Victoire were like dead men walking, pale-faced and jumpy, flinching at the slightest noises, and unable to engage in the simplest small talk without assuming expressions of utter terror. Neither of them had been punished by the university. Neither of them had even been called in for questioning. But surely, Robin thought, Professor Lovell at least suspected their involvement. The guilt was written all over their faces.",
    "Robin wanted nothing more than to discuss things with Ramy and Victoire, but they never had the opportunity. Letty was always there. Even at night, when they retreated into their separate cabins, there was no chance that Victoire could sneak away to join the boys without Letty growing suspicious. They had no choice but to pretend everything was normal, but they were dreadful at this. They were all clammy, fidgety, and irritable. None of them could drum up enthusiasm for what ought to have been the most exciting chapter of their careers.",
    "And they couldn\u2019t make conversation about anything else; none of their old jokes or inconsequential debates came easily to mind, and whenever they did, they sounded heavy and forced. Letty \u2013 pushy, chatty, and oblivious \u2013 was grating on them all, and though they tried to conceal their irritation, for it wasn\u2019t her fault, they couldn\u2019t help snapping at her when she asked their thoughts on Cantonese cuisine for the dozenth time..",
    "\u2018Don\u2019t pretend,\u2019 Letty snapped. \u2018You\u2019re all acting bizarre. You won\u2019t touch your food, you\u2019re mangling your lessons \u2013 I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve even touched your phrasebook, Ramy, which is funny because you\u2019ve been saying for months that you bet you could imitate a better Chinese accent than Robin\u2014\u2019",
    "Victoire called after him, but he pretended not to hear. He felt guilty abandoning her and Ramy to Letty, for fleeing the catastrophic fallout, but he couldn\u2019t bear to be at that table for another moment. He felt very hot and agitated, as if a thousand ants were crawling around under his clothes. If he didn\u2019t get away, walk around, move, then he was sure he would explode.",
    "Outside, it was cold and quickly turning dark. The deck was empty except for Professor Lovell, who was having a smoke by the prow. Robin almost turned back around when he saw him \u2013 they had not uttered a word to each other except for pleasantries since the morning after he\u2019d been caught \u2013 but Professor Lovell had already seen him. He lowered his pipe and beckoned Robin to join him. Heart pounding, Robin approached.",
    "Robin didn\u2019t know how to respond, so he merely stared at him, waiting for him to continue. To his great surprise, Professor Lovell reached out then and placed a hand on Robin\u2019s shoulder. But the touch felt awkward, forced; the angles off, the pressure too heavy. They stood, strained and baffled, like two actors before a daguerreotype, holding their positions just until the light flashed.",
    "\u2018I believe in fresh starts,\u2019 said Professor Lovell. He seemed to have rehearsed these words; they came out as stilted and awkward as his touch. \u2018What I mean to say, Robin, is that you\u2019re very talented. We\u2019d be sorry to lose you.\u2019",
    "Professor Lovell cleared his throat, then waved his pipe around a bit before he spoke, as if coaxing his own words out of his chest. \u2018Anyhow, what I really wish to say is \u2013 which I perhaps ought to have said before \u2013 I can understand if you were feeling . . . disappointed by me.\u2019",
    "\u2018I should have been more sympathetic to your situation.\u2019 Professor Lovell glanced back out at the ocean. He seemed to have trouble looking Robin in the eye and speaking at the same time. \u2018Growing up outside your country, leaving everything you knew behind, adapting to a new environment where I\u2019m sure you received \u2013 well, less than the amount of care and affection you likely needed . . . Those were all things that affected Griffin as well, and I can\u2019t say I\u2019ve handled things better the second time. You are responsible for your own poor decisions, but I confess I do in part blame myself.\u2019",
    "He cleared his throat again. \u2018I\u2019d like for us to start anew. A clean slate for you, a renewed commitment on my part to be a better guardian. We\u2019ll pretend the past few days never happened. We\u2019ll put the Hermes Society, and Griffin, behind us. We\u2019ll think only of the future, and all the glorious and brilliant things you will achieve at Babel. Is that fair?\u2019",
    "Robin was momentarily struck dumb. To be honest, this was not a very large concession. Professor Lovell had only apologized for being, occasionally, somewhat distant. He hadn\u2019t apologized for refusing to claim Robin as a son. He hadn\u2019t apologized for letting his mother die.",
    "Robin turned back to the waves. He took another breath and closed his eyes, trying to imagine how he might feel if he really could erase the past week. He\u2019d be exhilarated, wouldn\u2019t he? He\u2019d be gazing over the horizon, hurtling into the future he\u2019d been training for. And what an exciting future \u2013 a successful Canton trip, a gruelling fourth year, and then graduation into a post at the Foreign Office or a fellowship in the tower. Repeat voyages to Canton, Macau, and Peking. A long and glorious career translating on behalf of the Crown. There were so very few qualified Sinologists in England.",
    "He could still have it. That was what Professor Lovell had been trying to tell him \u2013 that history was malleable, that all that mattered were decisions of the present. That they could bury Griffin and the Hermes Society into the recesses of the untouched past \u2013 he wouldn\u2019t even need to betray them, simply ignore them \u2013 just like they\u2019d buried everything else they\u2019d agreed was better left unmentioned.",
    "It was a week into the voyage before Robin, Ramy, and Victoire had a private moment to themselves. Halfway through their morning stroll, Letty went back below deck, claiming an upset stomach. Victoire offered half-heartedly to go with her, but Letty waved her off \u2013 she was still annoyed with them all, and clearly wanted to be alone.",
    "\u2018All right.\u2019 Victoire stepped closer to Robin and Ramy as soon as Letty had gone, closing off the gap made by her absence so that the three of them stood tight, an impenetrable silo against the wind. \u2018What in God\u2019s name\u2014\u2019",
    "\u2018A former Babel student. I think he\u2019s also \u2013 I mean, he said he\u2019s my half-brother. He looks just like me, we think Lovell \u2013 I mean, our father\u2014\u2019 Robin was tripping over his words. The Chinese character \u5e03 meant both \u2018cloth\u2019 and \u2018to relate, to tell\u2019. The truth was embroidered on a cloth tapestry, spread out to display its contents. But Robin, coming clean to his friends at last, had no idea where to start. The image he displayed was a jumbled and confused one, warped no matter how he told it by its complexity.",
    "\u2018Yes,\u2019 said Robin. \u2018Yes, I think Griffin would \u2013 Griffin is absolutely the kind of person who would have . . .\u2019 He shook his head. \u2018Listen, the important thing is that Lovell thinks I was acting alone. Has he talked to either one of you?\u2019",
    "\u2018We were going to,\u2019 said Victoire. \u2018We begged Anthony, we almost let it slip so many times \u2013 he kept telling us not to, but we decided we would break it to you ourselves, we were going to do it that Sunday\u2014\u2019",
    "\u2018Everything I\u2019ve worked for is this!\u2019 Ramy exclaimed. \u2018What, you think I came to Babel because I want to be a translator for the Queen? Birdie, I hate it in this country. I hate the way they look at me, I hate being passed around at their wine parties like an animal on display. I hate knowing that my very presence at Oxford is a betrayal of my race and religion, because I\u2019m becoming just that class of person Macaulay hoped to create. I\u2019ve been waiting for an opportunity like Hermes since I got here\u2014\u2019",
    "He didn\u2019t have to say why. Robin, whose father was on the faculty, who could pass for white under the right lighting, at the right angles, was shielded in a way Ramy and Victoire were not. If Ramy or Victoire had faced the police that night, they wouldn\u2019t have been on this ship, they would have been behind bars, or worse.",
    "\u2018But you\u2019re not careful,\u2019 Robin said, exasperated. So they were trading insults now. So they were being frank now. \u2018You were caught, weren\u2019t you? You\u2019re impulsive, you don\u2019t think \u2013 the moment anyone insults your pride you lash out\u2014\u2019",
    "\u2018Victoire\u2019s . . .\u2019 Robin trailed off. He had no defence. He hadn\u2019t told Victoire about Hermes because he\u2019d assumed she had too much to lose, but there was no good way to say this out loud, or to justify its logic.",
    "\u2018I\u2019ve just one more question,\u2019 Ramy said abruptly. He was really, truly furious, Robin realized. This was not merely a burst of Ramy-esque passion. This was something they perhaps could not come back from. \u2018What did you say to make it go away? What\u2019d you give up?\u2019",
    "Robin couldn\u2019t lie to Ramy\u2019s face. He wanted to; he was so afraid of the truth, and of the way Ramy would look at him when he heard it, but this he could not hide. It would rip him apart. \u2018He wanted information.\u2019",
    "\u2018Just what I knew,\u2019 Robin said. \u2018Which wasn\u2019t much, Griffin made sure of it \u2013 I never even knew what he did with the books I took out for him. All I told Lovell about was one safe room at St Aldate\u2019s.\u2019",
    "This was profoundly unfair, Robin thought. He\u2019d saved them \u2013 he\u2019d done the only thing he could think of to minimize the damage \u2013 which was more than Hermes had ever done for him. Why was he now under siege? \u2018I was only trying to save you\u2014\u2019",
    "\u2018Look,\u2019 Robin snapped. \u2018I don\u2019t have a family. I have a contract, a guardian, and a house in Canton full of dead relatives that for all I know could still be rotting in their beds. That\u2019s what I\u2019m sailing home to. You have Calcutta. Without Babel, I have nothing.\u2019",
    "The rest of the voyage was decidedly miserable. Ramy, it seemed, had said all he wanted to say. He and Robin passed all the hours they spent in their shared cabin in desperately uncomfortable silence. Mealtimes weren\u2019t much better. Victoire was polite but distant; there was little she could say in Letty\u2019s presence, and she didn\u2019t make much effort to seek Robin out otherwise. And Letty was still angry with all of them, which made small talk nigh impossible.",
    "Things would have been better if they had had a single other soul for company, but they were the only passengers on a trade ship where the sailors seemed interested in anything but befriending Oxford scholars, whom they considered an unwanted and ill-timed burden. Robin spent most of his days either alone above deck or alone in his cabin.",
    "Under any other circumstances, the voyage would have been a fascinating chance to examine the unique linguistics of nautical environments, which blended the necessary multilingualism brought about by foreign crews and foreign destinations with the highly technical vocabulary of seacraft. What was a banian day? What was marling? Was the anchor attached to the better end, or the bitter end? Normally he would have delighted in finding out. But he was busy sulking, still both baffled and resentful at how he\u2019d lost his friends in the process of trying to save them..",
    "Letty, poor thing, was the most confused of all. The rest of them at least understood the cause for the hostilities. Letty hadn\u2019t a clue what was going on. She was the only innocent here, unfairly caught in the crossfire. All she knew was that things were wrong and sour, and she was driving herself up the wall trying to figure out what the reason was. Someone else might have grown withdrawn and sullen, resentful at being shut out by their closest friends. But Letty was as pigheaded as ever, determined to resolve problems through brute force.",
    "But this had the opposite of her intended effect. Ramy began leaving the room every time she came in. Victoire, who as Letty\u2019s roommate could not escape her, started showing up at breakfast looking haggard and exasperated. When Letty asked her for the salt, Victoire snapped so viciously at her to get it herself that Letty reeled back, wounded.",
    "She meant Professor Lovell, Robin realized. Not Ramy. He was so relieved that he found himself engaging in the conversation. \u2018It\u2019s a strange arrangement,\u2019 he admitted. \u2018Only I\u2019ve grown so used to it that I\u2019ve stopped wondering why it isn\u2019t otherwise.\u2019",
    "\u2018Well, my father\u2014\u2019 she started, then broke off and coughed primly. \u2018I mean. You all know. My father won\u2019t speak to me, hasn\u2019t looked me in the eyes and spoken to me after Lincoln, and . . . I just wanted to say, I know a bit what it\u2019s like. That\u2019s all.\u2019",
    "But she took the gesture at face value. She, too, must have been starved for familiar contact, for some indication that her friends still liked her. \u2018And I just wanted to say, I\u2019m here for you.\u2019 She took his hand in hers. \u2018I hope this isn\u2019t too forward, but it\u2019s just that I\u2019ve noticed, he\u2019s not treating you the same, not the way he used to. He won\u2019t look you in the eyes, and he won\u2019t speak to you directly. And I don\u2019t know what happened, but it\u2019s not right, and it\u2019s very unfair what he\u2019s done to you. And I want you to know that if you want to talk, Birdie, I\u2019m here.\u2019",
    "She never called him Birdie. That\u2019s Ramy\u2019s word, Robin almost uttered, before realizing that would be the absolute worst thing to say. He tried to remind himself to be kind. She was, after all, only attempting her version of comfort. Letty was bull-headed and overbearing, but she did care.",
    "At least there was work to distract. Babel\u2019s practice of sending entire cohorts, all of whom specialized in different languages, on the same graduation voyages was a testament to the reach and connectedness of the British trading companies. The colonial trade had its claws in dozens of countries across the world, and its labour, consumers, and producers spoke scores of tongues. During the voyage, Ramy was often asked to translate for the Urdu- and Bengali-speaking lascars; never mind that his Bengali was now rudimentary at best.",
    "Letty and Victoire were put to work looking over shipping manifests for their next leg to Mauritius, and translating stolen correspondences from French missionaries and French trading companies out of China \u2013 the Napoleonic Wars had ended, but the competition for empire had not..",
    "Every afternoon, Professor Lovell tutored Ramy, Letty, and Victoire in Mandarin from two to five. No one expected they would be fluent by the time they docked in Canton, but the point was to force-feed them enough vocabulary that they would understand basic salutations, directions, and common nouns. There was also, Professor Lovell argued, a great pedagogical benefit to learning a wholly new language in a very short amount of time; it forced the mind to stretch and build rapid connections, to contrast unfamiliar language structures with what one already knew.",
    "\u2018Chinese is awful,\u2019 Victoire complained to Robin one night after class. \u2018There are no conjugations, no tenses, no declensions \u2013 how do you ever know the meaning of a sentence? And don\u2019t get me started on tones. I simply can\u2019t hear them. Perhaps I\u2019m just not very musical, but I really can\u2019t tell the difference. I\u2019m starting to think they\u2019re a hoax.\u2019",
    "\u2018It doesn\u2019t matter,\u2019 Robin assured her. He was mostly glad she was talking to him at all. After three weeks Ramy had finally deigned to exchange basic civilities, but Victoire \u2013 though she still held him at arm\u2019s length \u2013 had forgiven him enough to speak to him like a friend. \u2018They don\u2019t speak Mandarin in Canton anyway. You\u2019d need Cantonese to actually get around.\u2019",
    "In the evenings, Professor Lovell primed them for the purpose of their mission in Canton. They were going to help negotiate on behalf of several private trading companies, foremost among them Jardine, Matheson & Company. This would be more difficult than it sounded, for trade relations with the Qing court had been marked by mutual misunderstanding and suspicion since the end of the past century. The Chinese, wary of foreign influences, preferred to keep the British contained with other foreign traders at Canton and Macau.",
    "The three previous attempts by the British to negotiate broader trading rights had ended in abject failure. In 1793, the Macartney embassy became a global punchline when Lord George Macartney refused to kowtow to the Qianlong Emperor and came away with nothing. The Amherst embassy of 1816 went very much the same way when Lord William Amherst similarly refused to kowtow to the Jiaqing Emperor and was subsequently refused admission to Peking at all.",
    "Theirs would be the fourth such delegation. \u2018It\u2019ll be different this time,\u2019 vowed Professor Lovell, \u2018because at last they\u2019ve called on Babel translators to lead the talks. No more fiascoes of cultural miscommunication.\u2019",
    "\u2018You\u2019d be surprised how often traders think they shouldn\u2019t need our help,\u2019 said Professor Lovell. \u2018They tend to assume everyone should naturally just learn to speak and behave like the English. They\u2019ve done a fairly good job at provoking local animosity with that attitude, if the Canton papers aren\u2019t exaggerating. Expect some less-than-friendly natives.\u2019",
    "They all had a good idea of the kind of tension they would see in China. They\u2019d read more and more coverage of Canton in London\u2019s newspapers of late, which mostly reported the kinds of ignominies British merchants were suffering at the hands of brutal local barbarians. Chinese forces, according to The Times, were intimidating merchants, attempting to expel them from their homes and factories, and publishing insulting things about them in their own press.",
    "\u2018The problem is that the Chinese have convinced themselves that they\u2019re the most superior nation in the world,\u2019 he said. \u2018They insist on using the word yi to describe Europeans in their official memos, though we\u2019ve asked them time and time again to use something more respectful, as yi is a designation for barbarians. And they take this attitude into all trade and legal negotiations. They recognize no laws except their own, and they don\u2019t regard foreign trade as an opportunity, but as a pesky incursion to be dealt with.\u2019",
    "\u2018It might be the best thing for them,\u2019 said Professor Lovell with surprising vehemence. \u2018It\u2019d do well to teach them a lesson. China is a nation of semi-barbarous people in the grips of backward Manchu rulers, and it would do them good to be forcibly opened to commercial enterprise and progress. No, I wouldn\u2019t oppose a bit of a shake-up. Sometimes a crying child must be spanked.\u2019",
    "Six weeks at last came to an end. Professor Lovell informed them at dinner one night that they could expect to dock at Canton by noon the next day. Prior to disembarking, Victoire and Letty were requested to bind their chests and to clip their hair, which they\u2019d grown long during their years as upperclassmen, above their ears.",
    "\u2018The expats here hire local servants, and they keep their wives in Macau. They\u2019re quite serious about enforcing these laws. The last time a British man tried to bring his wife to Canton \u2013 William Baynes, I believe it was \u2013 the local authorities threatened to send in soldiers to remove her.* Anyhow, it\u2019s for your own benefit. The Chinese treat women very badly. They have no conception of chivalry. They hold their women in low esteem and, in some cases, don\u2019t even permit them to leave the house. You\u2019ll be better off if they think you\u2019re young men.",
    "The next morning they spent the sunrise hour above deck, milling about the prow, occasionally leaning over the railing as if those inches of difference would help them spot what navigational science claimed they were fast approaching. The thick dawn mists had just given way to blue sky when the horizon revealed a thin strip of green and grey. Slowly this acquired detail, like a dream materializing; the blurred colours became a coast, became a silhouette of buildings behind a mass of ships docking at the tiny point where the Middle Kingdom encountered the world.",
    "This was the first time they\u2019d spoken directly to each other in weeks. It was not a truce \u2013 Ramy still refused to look him in the eyes. But it was an opening, a grudging acknowledgment that despite everything, Ramy still cared, and for that Robin was grateful.",
    "\u2018I\u2019m thinking about the Chinese character for dawn,\u2019 he said truthfully. He couldn\u2019t let himself dwell on the larger magnitude of it all. His thoughts threatened to spiral to places he feared he could not control unless he brought them down to the familiar distraction of language. \u2018D\u00e0n. It looks like this.\u2019 He drew the character in the air: \u65e6. \u2018Up top is the radical for the sun \u2013 r\u00ec.\u2019 He drew \u65e5. \u2018And under that, a line. And I\u2019m just thinking about how it\u2019s beautiful because it\u2019s so simple. It\u2019s the most direct use of pictography, see. Because dawn is just the sun coming up over the horizon.\u2019",
    "A year ago, after overhearing Colin and the Sharp brothers loudly discussing it in the common room, Robin had gone alone to London over a weekend to see the celebrated Afong Moy. Advertised as the \u2018Chinese Lady\u2019, Afong Moy had been brought out of China by a pair of American traders who\u2019d initially hoped to use an Oriental lady to showcase goods acquired overseas, but who quickly realized they could instead make a fortune exhibiting her person across the eastern seaboard. This was her first tour to England.",
    "Robin had read somewhere that she was also from Canton. He wasn\u2019t sure what he\u2019d hoped for other than a glimpse of, perhaps a moment of connection with, someone who shared his motherland. His ticket granted him admission to a garish stage room advertised as a \u2018Chinese Saloon\u2019, decorated with randomly placed ceramics, shoddy imitations of Chinese paintings, and a suffocating quantity of gold and red damask illuminated by cheap paper lanterns. The Chinese Lady herself was seated on a chair at the front of the room.",
    "She wore a blue silk buttoned shirt, and her feet, bound conspicuously in linen, were propped up on a small cushion before her. She looked very small. The pamphlet he\u2019d been handed at the ticket booth claimed she was somewhere in her twenties, but she could have easily been as young as twelve..",
    "The story of her feet was also explained in the pamphlet. Like many young Chinese women, Afong Moy\u2019s feet had been broken and bound when she was young to restrict their growth and to leave them curved in an unnatural arch that gave her a tottering, unstable gait. As she walked across the stage, the men around Robin pushed forward, trying to get a closer look. But Robin could not understand the appeal. The sight of her feet seemed neither erotic nor fascinating, but rather a great invasion of intimacy.",
    "Afong May returned to her chair. Her eyes locked suddenly on Robin\u2019s; she seemed to have scanned the room and found kinship in his face. Cheeks flushing, he averted his eyes. When she started to sing \u2013 a lilting, haunting melody that he did not recognize and could not understand \u2013 he pushed his way through the crowd and left the room.",
    "As they sailed inland, he noticed that Letty kept looking at his face, then at the dockworkers\u2019 faces, as if comparing them. Perhaps she was trying to determine precisely how Chinese he looked, or to see if he was experiencing some great emotional catharsis. But nothing stirred in his chest. Standing on the deck, minutes from stepping foot in his motherland after a lifetime away, all Robin felt was empty.",
    "They made anchor and disembarked at Whampoa, where they boarded smaller boats to continue up Canton\u2019s riverfront. Here, the city became a wash of noise, of the ongoing rumbling and humming of gongs, firecrackers, and shouting boatmen moving their craft up and down the river. It was unbearably loud. Robin did not remember such a din from his childhood; either Canton had grown much busier, or his ears had grown unaccustomed to its sounds.",
    "They stepped ashore at Jackass Point, where they were met by Mr Baylis, their liaison with Jardine, Matheson & Co. Mr Baylis was a short, well-dressed man with dark, clever eyes who spoke with astonishing animation. \u2018You couldn\u2019t have arrived at a better time,\u2019 he said, pumping Professor Lovell\u2019s hand, then Robin\u2019s, and then Ramy\u2019s. The girls he ignored. \u2018It\u2019s a disaster here \u2013 the Chinese are getting bolder and bolder by the day.",
    "They\u2019ve broken up the distribution rings \u2013 they bombed one of the fast crabs to bits in the harbour just the other day, thank God no one was on board \u2013 and the crackdowns will make trade impossible if this keeps up.\u2019.",
    "\u2018That was a workaround, but only for a bit. Then the Viceroy started sending his people door to door on house searches. The whole city\u2019s terrified. You\u2019ll scare a man off just by mentioning the name of the drug. It\u2019s all the fault of that new Imperial Commissioner the Emperor has sent down. Lin Zexu. You\u2019ll meet him soon; he\u2019s the one we\u2019ll have to deal with.\u2019 Mr Baylis spoke so quickly as they walked that Robin was astonished he never ran out of breath. \u2018So he comes in and demands the immediate surrender of all opium brought to China. This was last March.",
    "\u2018Oh, well, it really wasn\u2019t so bad. The Chinese staff went home, which was a trial \u2013 I had to do my own washing, and that was a disaster \u2013 but otherwise we generally kept our spirits high. Really the only harms were overfeeding and lack of exercise.\u2019 Mr Baylis gave a short, nasty laugh. \u2018Happily that\u2019s over with, and now we can stroll around outside as we wish, no harm done. But there must be penalties, Richard. They\u2019ve got to learn they can\u2019t get away with this. Ah \u2013 here we are, ladies and gents, here is your home from home.\u2019",
    "Past the southwestern suburbs they came upon a row of thirteen buildings in a line, all visibly Western in design, replete with recessed verandahs, neoclassical ornaments, and European flags. These looked so jarring against the rest of Canton that it seemed as if some giant had dug up a neat strip of France or England and dropped it wholesale onto the city\u2019s edge. These were the Factories, explained Mr Baylis, named not because they were centres of production, but because they were the residences of the factors \u2013 the agents of trade.",
    "They were to stay at the New English Factory. Mr Baylis led them quickly through the ground-floor warehouse, past the social room and dining room to the visiting chambers on the upper floors. There were also, he pointed out, a well-stocked library, several rooftop terraces, and even a garden facing the riverside.",
    "\u2018Now, they\u2019re very strict about keeping foreigners within the foreign enclave, so don\u2019t go exploring by yourselves,\u2019 Mr Baylis warned. \u2018Stay within the Factories. There\u2019s a corner in the Imperial Factory \u2013 that\u2019s number three \u2013 where Markwick & Lane sell all sorts of European goods you might need, though they haven\u2019t got many books apart from nautical charts. Those flower boats are strictly off limits, do you hear me? Our merchant friends can arrange for some women of a more discreet temperament to visit in the evenings if you need some company \u2013 no?\u2019",
    "Robin and Ramy\u2019s room was quite gloomy. The walls, which must have originally been painted dark green, were now nearly black. The girls\u2019 room was as dark, and considerably smaller; there was barely space to walk between the single bed and the wall. It also had no windows. Robin could not see how they were possibly expected to live there for two weeks.",
    "After putting down their things, they congregated in the dining room, which was furnished with one very large table capable of seating at least twenty-five. Over the middle of the table was suspended an immense fan made of a cloth sail stretched over a wooden frame, which was kept in constant motion by a coolie servant who pulled and slackened it without pause throughout the dinner service. Robin found it quite distracting \u2013 he felt an odd pang of guilt every time he met the servant\u2019s eyes \u2013 but the other residents of the factory seemed to find the coolie invisible.",
    "Dinner that night was one of the most ghastly and uncomfortable affairs Robin had ever endured. The men at the table included both Jardine & Matheson employees and a number of representatives from other shipping companies \u2013 Magniac & Co., J. Scott & Co., and others whose names Robin promptly forgot. They were all white men who seemed cut from precisely the same cloth as Mr Baylis \u2013 superficially charming and talkative men who, despite their clean-cut attire, seemed to exude an air of intangible dirtiness.",
    "Apart from businessmen there was Reverend Karl G\u00fctzlaff, a German-born missionary who apparently did more interpreting for the shipping companies than conversion of Chinese souls. Reverend G\u00fctzlaff proudly informed them that he was also a member of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge in China,* and was currently writing a series of articles for a Chinese-language magazine to teach the Chinese about the difficult Western concept of free trade..",
    "\u2018We\u2019re delighted to have you working with us,\u2019 said Mr Baylis to Robin as the first course \u2013 a bland gingery soup \u2013 was served. \u2018It\u2019s so hard to find good Chinese translators that can string together a full sentence in English. The Western-trained ones are much better. You\u2019ll be interpreting for me during my audience with the Commissioner on Thursday.\u2019",
    "\u2018I am?\u2019 Robin was startled. \u2018Why me?\u2019 This was a fair question, he thought; he\u2019d never interpreted professionally before, and it seemed odd to choose him for an audience with the greatest authority in Canton. \u2018Why not Reverend G\u00fctzlaff? Or Professor Lovell?\u2019",
    "The company men all chuckled, though Robin couldn\u2019t see what was so funny. A certain smugness underwrote this entire exchange, an air of brotherly fraternity, of shared access to some long-running joke the rest of them didn\u2019t understand. It reminded Robin of Professor Lovell\u2019s gatherings in Hampstead, as he\u2019d never been able to tell what the joke was back then either, or what the men had to be so satisfied about.",
    "No one was drinking much of their soup. Servants cleared their bowls away and replaced them with both the main course and dessert at once. The main course was potatoes with some sort of grey, sauce-covered lump \u2013 either beef or pork, Robin couldn\u2019t tell. Dessert was even more mysterious, a violently orange thing that looked a bit like a sponge.",
    "\u2018The kitchen staff are all Chinks,\u2019 explained Mr Baylis. \u2018They\u2019ve never been to England. We keep describing the foods we\u2019d like, and of course they have no idea how it tastes or how to make it, but it\u2019s still funny to see them try. Afternoon tea is better. They understand the point of sweet treats, and we\u2019ve got our own English cows here to supply the milk.\u2019",
    "\u2018Anyhow,\u2019 said Mr Baylis, \u2018the Commissioner is going to be devilishly difficult to work with. Rumours are he\u2019s very strict, extremely uptight. He thinks Canton is a cesspool of corruption, and that all Western traders are nefarious villains intent on swindling his government.\u2019",
    "\u2018I do prefer when they underestimate us,\u2019 Mr Baylis agreed. \u2018Now, Robin Swift, the issue at hand is the opium bond, which would make all foreign ships assume responsibility before Chinese law for any opium they may smuggle in. It used to be that this ban existed on paper only. We\u2019d dock our ships at \u2013 how shall we call them? \u2013 outer anchorages, like Lintin and Camsingmoon and such, where we\u2019d distribute cargo for resale with local partners. But that\u2019s all changed under Commissioner Lin. His arrival, as I\u2019ve told you, was quite the shake-up.",
    "Captain Elliot \u2013 good man, but he\u2019s a coward where it matters \u2013 defused the situation by letting them confiscate all the opium we had in our possession.\u2019 Here Mr Baylis clutched his chest as if physically pained. \u2018Over twenty thousand chests. Do you know how much that\u2019s worth? Nearly two and a half million pounds. That\u2019s unjust seizure of British property, I tell you. Surely that\u2019s grounds for war. Captain Elliot thinks he saved us from starvation and violence, but he\u2019s only shown the Chinese that they can walk all over us.\u2019 Mr Baylis pointed his fork at Robin.",
    "\u2018Well, it seems the ultimatum on opium is a bit extreme,\u2019 said Robin. \u2018I don\u2019t see why you couldn\u2019t break it into some more piecemeal deals. I mean, certainly you could still negotiate on all the other exports\u2014\u2019",
    "\u2018Oh, opium\u2019s not as harmful as all that,\u2019 said Reverend G\u00fctzlaff. \u2018Indeed, it\u2019s prescribed as laudanum in Britain all the time. Little old ladies regularly use it to go to sleep. It\u2019s no more a vice than tobacco or brandy. I often recommend it to members of my congregation.\u2019",
    "\u2018That\u2019s missing the point,\u2019 said Mr Baylis with a touch of impatience. \u2018The point is free trade between nations. We\u2019re all liberals, aren\u2019t we? There should be no restrictions between those who have goods and those who want to purchase them. That\u2019s justice.\u2019",
    "Mr Baylis scoffed. \u2018Oh, the Qing Emperor doesn\u2019t care about vices. He\u2019s stingy about his silver, that\u2019s all. But trade only works when there\u2019s give and take, and currently we\u2019re sitting at a deficit. There\u2019s nothing we have that those Chinamen want, apparently, except opium. They can\u2019t get enough of the stuff. They\u2019ll pay anything for it. And if I had my way, every man, woman, and child in this country would be puffing opium smoke until they couldn\u2019t think straight.\u2019",
    "\u2018It\u2019s their free choice, isn\u2019t it?\u2019 Mr Baylis said. \u2018You can\u2019t fault business. Chinamen are simply filthy, lazy, and easily addicted. And you certainly can\u2019t blame England for the foibles of an inferior race. Not where there\u2019s money to be made.\u2019",
    "Translation work began promptly the next day. Good linguists were always in heavy demand at Canton, and were pulled in a dozen different directions whenever they did show up. Western traders did not like using the government-licensed native Chinese linguists because their language skills were so often subpar.",
    "\u2018Forget English,\u2019 complained Mr Baylis to Professor Lovell, \u2018half of them aren\u2019t even fluent in Mandarin. And you can\u2019t trust them to represent your interests besides. You can always tell when they\u2019re not giving you the truth \u2013 I once had a man lie to my face about the customs rates when the Arabic numerals were right there.\u2019",
    "The trading companies occasionally employed Westerners fluent in Chinese, but they were hard to find. Officially, teaching Chinese to a foreigner was a crime punishable by death. Now, as China\u2019s borders were slightly more porous, this law was impossible to enforce, but it did mean skilled translators were often missionaries like Reverend G\u00fctzlaff with little spare time. The upshot was that people like Robin and Professor Lovell were worth their weight in gold.",
    "Ramy, Letty, and Victoire, poor things, would be shuttled from factory to factory all day doing silver-work maintenance, but Robin and Professor Lovell\u2019s itineraries were crammed with meetings starting from eight in the morning..",
    "Promptly after breakfast, Robin accompanied Mr Baylis to the harbour to go over shipping manifests with Chinese customs officials. The customs office had supplied their own translator, a reedy, bespectacled man named Meng who uttered each English word with slow, timid deliberateness, as if terrified of mispronouncing anything.",
    "\u2018We will now go over the inventory,\u2019 he told Robin. His deferential, upwards-trailing tone made it sound as if he were asking a question; Robin could not tell if he was asking him for permission or not.",
    "Meng began reading off the inventory list, glancing up after every item so that Mr Baylis could confirm in which boxes those goods had been stored. \u2018One hundred twenty-five pounds copper. Seventy-eight pounds ginseng crude. Twenty-four boxes be . . . beetle\u2014\u2019",
    "\u2018Oh, enough of this,\u2019 snapped Mr Baylis. \u2018Let Robin do it \u2013 you can translate the whole list, can\u2019t you, Robin? It would save us a good deal of time. They\u2019re hopeless, I told you, all of them \u2013 a whole country, and not a single competent English speaker among them.\u2019",
    "It went on like this all morning: Mr Baylis met with a procession of Chinese agents, all of whom he treated with incredible rudeness, and then looked to Robin as if expecting him to translate not only his words but his utter contempt for his interlocutors.",
    "By the time they adjourned for lunch, Robin had developed a painful, throbbing headache. He could not take another moment of Mr Baylis\u2019s company. Even supper, which was served back in the English Factory, was no respite; Mr Baylis spent the whole time recounting silly claims the customs officials had made, and kept casting his stories in a way that made Robin sound like he\u2019d verbally slapped the Chinese at every turn. Ramy, Victoire, and Letty looked very confused. Robin scarcely spoke.",
    "They walked out the front door and down the length of the Thirteen Factories. When they crossed from the foreign enclave into the Cantonese suburbs, no one stopped them; no one seized them by the arm and insisted they return to where they belonged. Even Ramy\u2019s face attracted no peculiar comment; Indian lascars were a common sight in Canton, and they attracted less attention than white foreigners. It was, strangely, a complete reversal of their situation in England.",
    "Robin led them through the streets of downtown Canton at random. He didn\u2019t know what he was looking for. Childhood haunts? Familiar landmarks? He had no destination in mind; no place he thought would bring catharsis. All he felt was a deep urgency, a need to walk over as much territory as he could before the sun went down.",
    "Canton was wildly different from the way he\u2019d left it. The construction on the docks, which had been going on since Robin could remember, had exploded into entire complexes of new buildings \u2013 warehouses, company offices, inns, restaurants, and teahouses. But what else had he expected? Canton had always been a shifting, dynamic city, sucking in what the sea delivered and digesting it all into its own peculiar hybridity. How could he ever assume it might remain rooted in the past?",
    "Robin thought of that dry, stuffy house; the stink of diarrhoea and decomposing bodies. It was the last place in the world he wanted to visit again. But it seemed even worse not to have a look. \u2018I\u2019m not sure I can find it. But we can try.\u2019",
    "Eventually Robin found his way back to his old home \u2013 not by following the streets, which had now become wholly unfamiliar, but by walking until the distance between the docks, the river, and the setting sun felt familiar. Yes, this was where home should have been \u2013 he remembered the curve of the riverfront, as well as the rickshaw lot on the opposite bank.",
    "The street didn\u2019t resemble anything he remembered. His family house had disappeared off the face of the planet. He couldn\u2019t even tell where its foundations lay \u2013 they could have been beneath the tea shop in front of them, or the company office to its left, or the lavishly ornamented shop near the end of the street with a sign that read, in garish red paint: hu\u0101 y\u0101n gu\u01cen. Flower-smoke shop. An opium den.",
    "\u2018It\u2019s where all the opium goes. They come here to smoke it.\u2019 Robin felt a sudden unbearable curiosity. His gaze darted around the shopfront, trying to memorize every detail of it \u2013 the large paper lanterns, the lacquered exterior, the girls in face paint and long skirts beckoning from the shopfront. They beamed at him, extending their arms like dancers as he approached.",
    "\u2018One moment.\u2019 Robin felt compelled by some fierce, twisted desire to know, the same vicious urge that compelled one to prod at a sore, just to see how badly it could hurt. \u2018I just want to have a look around.\u2019",
    "\u2018Would you like to try?\u2019 The hostess held out a pipe towards him. It was already lit; the pot glowed with gently burning opium, and a small trickle of smoke unfurled from the tip. \u2018Your first on the house, mister.\u2019",
    "The den was filled with men. Robin hadn\u2019t noticed them before, it was so dark, but now he saw that there were at least a dozen opium smokers sprawled over low couches in various states of undress. Some fondled girls perched atop their laps, some listlessly played a gambling game, and some lay alone in a stupor, mouths half-open and eyes half-closed, staring out at nothing.",
    "Your uncle couldn\u2019t stay away from those dens. The sight prompted words he hadn\u2019t recalled in a decade, words in his mother\u2019s voice, words she\u2019d sighed throughout his childhood. We used to be rich, darling. Look at us now.",
    "He thought of his mother reminiscing bitterly about the gardens she used to tend and the dresses she used to wear before his uncle frittered their family fortune away in an opium den like this. He imagined his mother, young and desperate, eager to do anything for the foreign man who promised her coin, who used and abused her and left her with an English maid and a bewildering set of instructions to raise their child, her child, in a language she couldn\u2019t speak herself. Robin was birthed by choices produced from poverty, poverty produced from this.",
    "Before he registered what he was doing, the pipe was in his mouth \u2013 he was breathing in, the hostess was smiling wider, saying something he didn\u2019t understand, and everything was sweet and dizzy and lovely and awful all at once. He coughed, then sucked in hard again; he had to see how addictive this stuff was, if it really could make one sacrifice all else.",
    "They walked briskly back through the city, this time with Ramy in the lead. Robin didn\u2019t speak a word. He couldn\u2019t tell how much those few draughts of opium had affected him, whether he was only imagining his symptoms. Once, out of curiosity, he had thumbed through a copy of De Quincey\u2019s Confessions of an English Opium-Eater, which described the effect of opium as communicating \u2018serenity and equipoise\u2019 to all the faculties, of \u2018greatly invigorating\u2019 one\u2019s self-possession, and of giving \u2018an expansion to the heart\u2019. But he felt none of those things.",
    "\u2018It\u2019s called y\u00e1nghu\u00f2,\u2019* said Robin. \u2018That\u2019s what she called the opium. Y\u00e1ng means \u201cforeign\u201d, hu\u00f2 means \u201cgoods\u201d. Y\u00e1nghu\u00f2 means \u201cforeign goods\u201d. That\u2019s how they refer to everything here. Y\u00e1ng people. Y\u00e1ng guilds. Y\u00e1nghu\u00f2re \u2013 an obsession with foreign goods, with opium. And that\u2019s me. That\u2019s coming from me. I\u2019m y\u00e1ng.\u2019",
    "They paused over a bridge, beneath which fishermen and sampans went back and forth. The din of it, the cacophony of a language he\u2019d spent so much time away from and now had to focus on to decipher, made Robin want to press his hands against his ears, to block out a soundscape that should have but did not feel like home.",
    "\u2018I should have told you,\u2019 Robin insisted. \u2018I should have, and I didn\u2019t, because somehow I still had it all split in my head, and I never put the two pieces together because I just didn\u2019t see . . . I just \u2013 I don\u2019t know how I didn\u2019t see.\u2019",
    "\u2018You know,\u2019 he said quietly, \u2018Sir Horace Wilson, my guardian, once took me to one of the opium fields he\u2019d invested in. In West Bengal. I don\u2019t think I ever told you about it. That\u2019s where the bulk of this stuff is grown \u2013 in Bengal, Bihar, and Patna. Sir Horace owned a share in one of the plantations. He was so proud; he thought this was the future of the colonial trade. He made me shake hands with his fieldworkers. He told them that someday, I might be their supervisor. This stuff changed everything, he said. This corrected the trade deficit.",
    "\u2018I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever forget what I saw.\u2019 He rested his elbows against the bridge and sighed. \u2018Rows and rows of flowers. A whole ocean of them. They\u2019re such bright scarlet that the fields look wrong, like the land itself is bleeding. It\u2019s all grown in the countryside. Then it gets packed and transported to Calcutta, where it\u2019s handed off to private merchants who bring it straight here. The two most popular opium brands here are called Patna and Malwa. Both regions in India. From my home straight to yours, Birdie. Isn\u2019t that funny?\u2019 Ramy glanced sideways at him.",
    "Robin saw a great spider\u2019s web in his mind then. Cotton from India to Britain, opium from India to China, silver becoming tea and porcelain in China, and everything flowing back to Britain. It sounded so abstract \u2013 just categories of use, exchange, and value \u2013 until it wasn\u2019t; until you realized the web you lived in and the exploitations your lifestyle demanded, until you saw looming above it all the spectre of colonial labour and colonial pain.",
    "\u2018But it\u2019s just trade,\u2019 said Ramy. \u2018Everyone benefits; everyone profits, even if it\u2019s only one country that profits a good deal more. Continuous gains \u2013 that\u2019s the logic, isn\u2019t it? So why would we ever try to break out? The point is, Birdie, I think I understand why you didn\u2019t see. Almost no one does.\u2019",
    "Free trade. This was always the British line of argument \u2013 free trade, free competition, an equal playing field for all. Only it never ended up that way, did it? What \u2018free trade\u2019 really meant was British imperial dominance, for what was free about a trade that relied on a massive build-up of naval power to secure maritime access? When mere trading companies could wage war, assess taxes, and administer civil and criminal justice?",
    "Griffin was right to be angry, thought Robin, but he was wrong to think he could do anything about it. These trade networks were carved in stone. Nothing was pushing this arrangement off its course; there were too many private interests, too much money at stake. They could see where it was going, but the people who had the power to do anything about it had been placed in positions where they would profit, and the people who suffered most had no power at all.",
    "As if what? As if he\u2019d seen anything properly horrible? As if he\u2019d seen the slave plantations in the West Indies at the height of their cruelty, or the starved bodies in India, victims of utterly avoidable famines, or the slaughtered natives of the New World? All he\u2019d seen was one opium den \u2013 but that was enough to act as synecdoche for the awful, undeniable rest.",
    "\u2018No, I don\u2019t, I just . . .\u2019 Robin squeezed his eyes shut. His thoughts were so jumbled; he had no idea how to convey what he meant, and all he could grasp at were memories, passing references. \u2018Did you ever read Gulliver\u2019s Travels? I read it all the time, when I lived here \u2013 I read it so often I nearly memorized it. And there\u2019s this chapter where Gulliver winds up on a land ruled by horses, who call themselves the Houyhnhnms, and where the humans are savage, idiot slaves called Yahoos. They\u2019re swapped.",
    "And Gulliver gets so used to living with his Houyhnhnm master, gets so convinced of Houyhnhnm superiority, that when he gets home, he\u2019s horrified by his fellow humans. He thinks they\u2019re imbeciles. He can\u2019t stand to be around them. And that\u2019s how this . . . that\u2019s . . .\u2019 Robin rocked back and forth over the bridge. He felt like no matter how hard he breathed, he could not get enough air. \u2018Do you know what I mean?\u2019.",
    "Mr Baylis did not appear to notice. \u2018Now, be on your toes. The Chinese are a devilishly tricky sort \u2013 duplicitous by nature, and all that. Always saying one thing when they mean quite the opposite. Careful you don\u2019t let them get the better of you.\u2019",
    "By Mr Baylis\u2019s account, one would imagine Commissioner Lin was nine-foot tall, had eyes that could shoot fire and trickster\u2019s horns. In person, the Commissioner was a mild-mannered, gentle-featured man of average height and build. His person was entirely nondescript save for his eyes, which seemed unusually bright and perceptive. He had with him his own interpreter, a young Chinese man who introduced himself as William Botelho, and who, to Robin\u2019s surprise, had studied English in the United States.",
    "\u2018The issue, as you know, is the opium trade,\u2019 said Mr Baylis. \u2018It is the opinion of Mr Jardine and Mr Matheson that it would benefit both your people and ours if their agents could legally sell opium along the coast in Canton without interference. They\u2019d appreciate an official apology for the inhospitable treatment their trading agents received earlier this year. And it seems only just that the twenty thousand chests of opium that were seized a few months ago are returned to us, or at least monetary compensation equivalent to their market value.\u2019",
    "For the first few moments Commissioner Lin only listened, blinking, as Robin continued to rattle off Mr Baylis\u2019s list of demands. Robin tried not to convey Mr Baylis\u2019s tone, which was loud and patronizing, but to instead deliver them in as flat and emotionless a manner as he could manage. Still, his ears reddened in embarrassment; this did not feel like a dialogue but a lecture, the sort one might give a dim child.",
    "Mr Baylis did not seem baffled by Commissioner Lin\u2019s lack of response; when his words met with silence, he merely continued: \u2018Misters Jardine and Matheson would also like to say that the Qing Emperor ought to realize his government\u2019s exclusive trade policies do not benefit the Chinese. Your own people, in fact, resent your trade barriers, which they believe do not represent their interests. They would much rather enjoy free association with foreigners, for that gives them too an opportunity to seek wealth.",
    "Finally, Commissioner Lin spoke. \u2018We know this.\u2019 William Botelho swiftly translated. It was an odd conversation, conveyed through four people, none of whom spoke directly to the person he was listening to. \u2018These are the precise terms in the many letters delivered from Misters Jardine and Matheson, no? Have you come to say anything new?\u2019",
    "Commissioner Lin clasped his hands behind his back, then asked, \u2018Mr Baylis, is it not true that in your own country, opium is prohibited with the utmost strictness and severity?\u2019 He paused to let William translate.",
    "\u2018And,\u2019 continued Commissioner Lin, \u2018does not the sanction against your own civilians\u2019 use of opium prove that you know full well how harmful it is to mankind? We should like to ask, has China ever sent forth a noxious article from its soil? Have we ever sold you anything save for that which is beneficial, that which your country has great demand for? Is your argument now that the opium trade is, in fact, good for us?\u2019",
    "\u2018The debate,\u2019 insisted Mr Baylis, \u2018is about economics. I once had an admiral seize my ship and search it for opium. When I explained to him I had none, as I follow the laws set by the Qing Emperor, he professed disappointment. He was hoping to purchase it wholesale and redistribute it himself, you see. Which proves the Chinese have much to profit from this trade as well\u2014\u2019",
    "\u2018I will reiterate to you what we wrote to your Queen Victoria,\u2019 said Commissioner Lin. \u2018Those who wish to trade with our celestial empire must obey the laws set down by the Emperor. And the Emperor\u2019s new law, about to be put into force, reads that any foreigners bringing opium into China with designs to sell it will be decapitated, and all property on board the ship will be confiscated.\u2019",
    "\u2018I am aware that you believe your interests will always supersede our laws,\u2019 said Commissioner Lin. \u2018Yet we stand inside Chinese territory. And so I will remind you, and your masters, that we will enforce our laws as we see fit.\u2019",
    "Robin was so amazed Mr Baylis had spoken these words out loud that he forgot to translate. There was an awkward pause. At last, William Botelho murmured Mr Baylis\u2019s meaning in Chinese to Commissioner Lin.",
    "Mr Baylis opened his mouth, seemed to think better of it, and then closed it. Irritated as he was, he\u2019d apparently realized that as much as he loved verbally berating the Chinese, he still couldn\u2019t issue a declaration of war without his government\u2019s backing.",
    "Robin allowed himself the simple pleasure of watching Mr Baylis\u2019s shock turn to indignation. He considered translating his stuttered protests, but decided on silence when it became clear none of it was coherent. At last Mr Baylis, for lack of any better option, allowed himself to be escorted out of the room.",
    "Then they were alone. Commissioner Lin gazed at him for a long, silent moment. Robin blinked, unable to sustain eye contact; he felt certain he was being searched, and this made him feel both inadequate and desperately uncomfortable.",
    "\u2018Robin Swift,\u2019 Robin said, then blinked, confused. The Anglophone name seemed incongruous for a conversation held in Chinese. His other name, his first name, had not been used for so long that it hadn\u2019t crossed his mind to say it.",
    "\u2018A very honourable profession,\u2019 said Commissioner Lin. \u2018Many of my countrymen look down on learning barbarian tongues. But I\u2019ve commissioned quite a few translation projects since I assumed power here. You must know the barbarians to control the barbarians, don\u2019t you think?\u2019",
    "\u2018Now I would like you to be frank with me,\u2019 said Commissioner Lin. \u2018Is there any point to negotiating this subject? If we swallowed our pride, if we bent the knee \u2013 would this mediate things whatsoever?\u2019",
    "Robin wanted to say yes. He wished he could claim that yes, of course, there was yet space to negotiate \u2013 that Britain and China, both being nations led by rational, enlightened people, could certainly find a middle ground without resorting to hostilities. But he knew this was not true. He knew Baylis, Jardine, and Matheson had no intention of compromising with the Chinese. Compromise required some acknowledgment that the other party deserved equal moral standing. But to the British, he\u2019d learned, the Chinese were like animals.",
    "\u2018Nothing,\u2019 Robin said. He felt slightly dizzy. The audience had ended so abruptly that he didn\u2019t know what to make of it. He\u2019d been so focused on the mechanics of translation, on conveying Mr Baylis\u2019s precise meanings, word for word, that he\u2019d failed to grasp the shift in the conversation. He sensed something momentous had just occurred, but he wasn\u2019t sure of what, nor his role in it. He kept going over the negotiation in his head, wondering if he\u2019d made some disastrous mistake. But it had all been so civil.",
    "Mr Baylis hurried immediately to the upstairs offices upon their return to the English Factory, leaving Robin alone in the lobby. He wasn\u2019t sure what to do with himself. He was supposed to have been out interpreting all afternoon, but Mr Baylis had absconded without any parting instructions. He waited in the lobby for a few minutes, then at last made his way to the sitting room, assuming it would be best to stay in a public area in case Mr Baylis decided he still needed him. Ramy, Letty, and Victoire sat at a table playing a game of cards.",
    "\u2018Finished early.\u2019 Ramy dealt him a hand. \u2018Gets a bit boring here when you can\u2019t speak the language, to be honest. We\u2019re thinking we might take a boat trip to see the Fa Ti river gardens later when we\u2019re allowed. How was the meeting with the Commissioner?\u2019",
    "\u2018I suppose,\u2019 Robin said. He couldn\u2019t shake a sense of foreboding, as if watching a gathering storm, waiting for the skies to split. The mood in the sitting room seemed too light-hearted, too tranquil. \u2018How are you all? You think they\u2019ll give you anything more interesting to do?\u2019",
    "A great fire roared on the opposite bank. But the burn, they saw when they rushed to the window, was a controlled burn; it only seemed catastrophic because of the billowing flames and smoke. When Robin squinted, he saw that the flames were contained at their source to a pile of chests loaded on deep-bellied boats that had been pushed out to the shallows. A few seconds later he smelled their contents: a sickly sweet scent carried by wind across the coast through the windows of the English Factory.",
    "\u2018Robin.\u2019 Professor Lovell stormed into the room, followed closely by Mr Baylis. Both looked furious; Professor Lovell\u2019s face in particular was twisted with a rage Robin had never seen on him. \u2018What did you do?\u2019",
    "It was the first time Professor Lovell had laid hands on him since that day in the library. Robin didn\u2019t know what Professor Lovell might do now \u2013 the look in his eyes was beastly, wholly unrecognizable. Please, Robin thought wildly. Please, hurt me, hit me, because then we\u2019ll know. Then there won\u2019t be any question. But the spell passed as quickly as it came. Professor Lovell let go of Robin, blinking, as if coming back to himself. He took a step back and dusted off the front of his jacket.",
    "The Hellas departed Pearl Bay with impressive haste. Within fifteen minutes of their boarding, the ropes were cut, the anchors pulled, and the sails unfurled. They darted out of the harbour, chased by billowing smoke that seemed to engulf the whole of the city.",
    "The crew, who had not been told until boarding that they would be responsible for the room and board of five additional passengers, were curt and annoyed. The Hellas was not a passenger ship, and its quarters were already cramped. Ramy and Robin were told to bunk with the sailors, but the girls were afforded a private cabin, which they shared with the only other civilian on board \u2013 a woman named Jemima Smythe, a Christian missionary from America who\u2019d tried to sneak into the mainland but was caught trying to ford the river into Canton\u2019s suburbs.",
    "\u2018Do you know what all the fuss is?\u2019 She kept asking this as they sat hunched together in the mess. \u2018Was it an accident, or did the Chinese do it on purpose? Will it be open war now, do you think?\u2019 The last question she kept repeating excitedly at intervals, despite their exasperated assurances that they did not know. At last she changed the subject to what they\u2019d been doing in Canton, and how they\u2019d passed their days in the English Factory. \u2018There are quite a few reverends under that roof, aren\u2019t there? What did you do for your Sunday services?\u2019 She stared inquiringly at Ramy.",
    "\u2018He\u2019s joking,\u2019 Letty said quickly before the horrified Miss Smythe could begin trying to convert him. \u2018He\u2019s Christian, of course \u2013 we all had to subscribe to the Thirty-Nine Articles at Oxford matriculation.\u2019*",
    "At last Miss Smythe grew tired of them and wandered above deck to say her prayers, or whatever it was that missionaries did. Robin, Letty, Ramy, and Victoire huddled around the table, fidgeting like naughty schoolchildren awaiting punishment. Professor Lovell was nowhere to be seen; the moment they\u2019d boarded, he\u2019d gone off to speak to the captain. Still, no one had told them what was going on, or what would happen next.",
    "\u2018I\u2019m fine.\u2019 Robin hoped they could not tell how quickly his heart was beating, or how loudly the blood thundered through his ears. He did not want to follow Professor Lovell; he wanted to hide and stall, to sit in the corner of the mess with his head buried in his arms. But this confrontation had been a long time coming. The fragile truce struck on the morning of his arrest was never sustainable. They\u2019d been lying to themselves for too long, he and his father. Things could not remain buried, hidden, and wilfully ignored forever. Sooner or later, things had to come to a head.",
    "\u2018I\u2019m curious.\u2019 Professor Lovell was sitting behind a desk, paging idly through a dictionary when Robin at last made his way to his cabin. \u2018Do you know the value of those chests burned in the harbour?\u2019",
    "Robin stepped inside and closed the door behind him. His knees trembled. He could have been eleven again, caught for reading fiction when he shouldn\u2019t have been, cringing from the impending blow. But he was not a child anymore. He tried his very best to keep his voice from wobbling. \u2018Sir, I don\u2019t know what happened with the Commissioner, but it\u2019s not\u2014\u2019",
    "\u2018Your job was not difficult. Be a mouthpiece for Harold Baylis. Present a friendly face to the Chinese. Smooth things over. I thought we were clear on your priorities here, no? What did you say to Commissioner Lin?\u2019",
    "\u2018I \u2013 all right, then.\u2019 Robin folded his arms. He had nothing to apologize for, nothing more to hide. Ramy and Victoire were safe; he had nothing to lose. No more bowing, no more silence. \u2018Fine. Let\u2019s be honest with each other. I don\u2019t agree with what Jardine & Matheson is doing in Canton. It\u2019s wrong, it disgusts me\u2014\u2019",
    "\u2018It\u2019s a nation of people,\u2019 Robin snapped. \u2018People you\u2019re poisoning, whose lives you\u2019re ruining. And if the question is whether I\u2019ll keep facilitating that project, then it\u2019s no \u2013 I won\u2019t come back to Canton again, not for the traders, and not for anything remotely related to opium. I\u2019ll do research at Babel, I\u2019ll do translations, but I won\u2019t do that. You can\u2019t make me.\u2019",
    "He was breathing very hard when he finished. Professor Lovell\u2019s expression had not changed. He watched Robin for a long moment, eyelids half-closed, tapping his fingers against his desk as if it were a piano.",
    "This line of argument again. Robin could have kicked something. Always this, the argument from bondage, as if his loyalties were shackled by privilege he had not asked for and did not choose to receive. Did he owe Oxford his life, just because he had drunk champagne within its cloisters? Did he owe Babel his loyalty because he had once believed its lies?",
    "\u2018You resent me, then?\u2019 asked Professor Lovell. \u2018For giving you a life? For giving you opportunities you couldn\u2019t have dreamed of?\u2019 He sneered. \u2018Yes, Robin, I took you from your home. From the squalor and disease and hunger. What do you want? An apology?\u2019",
    "What he wanted, Robin thought, was for Professor Lovell to admit what he\u2019d done. That it was unnatural, this entire arrangement; that children were not stock to be experimented on, judged for their blood, spirited away from their homeland in service of Crown and country. That Robin was more than a talking dictionary, and that his motherland was more than a fat golden goose. But he knew these were acknowledgments that Professor Lovell would never make.",
    "It was so obvious now that he was not, and could never be, a person in his father\u2019s eyes. No, personhood demanded the blood purity of the European man, the racial status that would make him Professor Lovell\u2019s equal. Little Dick and Philippa were persons. Robin Swift was an asset, and assets should be undyingly grateful that they were treated well at all.",
    "\u2018But I\u2019m just some Chink, Professor. I\u2019m also her son.\u2019 Robin felt a fierce urge to cry. He forced it down. Hurt never garnered sympathy from his father. But anger, perhaps, might spark fear. \u2018Did you think you\u2019d washed that part out of me?\u2019",
    "He had become so good at holding two truths in his head at once. That he was an Englishman and not. That Professor Lovell was his father and not. That the Chinese were a stupid, backwards people, and that he was also one of them. That he hated Babel, and wanted to live forever in its embrace. He had danced for years on the razor\u2019s edge of these truths, had remained there as a means of survival, a way to cope, unable to accept either side fully because an unflinching examination of the truth was so frightening that the contradictions threatened to break him.",
    "But he could not go on like this. He could not exist a split man, his psyche constantly erasing and re-erasing the truth. He felt a great pressure in the back of his mind. He felt like he would quite literally burst, unless he stopped being double. Unless he chose.",
    "Professor Lovell cocked his head. \u2018You know, I once thought that having offspring was a kind of translation of its own. Especially when the parents are of such vastly different stock. One is curious to see what ends up coming through.\u2019 His face underwent the strangest transformation as he spoke. His eyes grew larger and larger until they were frighteningly bulbous; his condescending sneer grew more pronounced, and his lips drew back to reveal teeth. It was meant, perhaps, as a look of exaggerated disgust, but it appeared more to Robin as if a mask of civility had been stripped away.",
    "It was the ugliest expression he had ever seen his father wear. \u2018I\u2019d hoped to raise you to avoid the failings of your brother. I hoped to instill you with a more civilized sense of ethics. Quo semel est imbuta recens, servabit odorem testa diu,* and all that. I hoped I might develop you into a more elevated cask. But for all your education, there is no raising you from that base, original stock, is there?\u2019.",
    "\u2018I haven\u2019t the time for this.\u2019 Professor Lovell flipped the dictionary shut. \u2018It\u2019s clear bringing you to Canton was the wrong idea. I had hoped it might remind you how lucky you were, but all it\u2019s done is confuse you.\u2019",
    "\u2018We\u2019ll re-evaluate your position at Babel when we return.\u2019 Professor Lovell gestured towards the door. \u2018For now, I think, you ought to take some time to reflect. Imagine spending the rest of your life in Newgate, Robin. You can rail against the evils of commerce all you like, if you do it in a prison cell. Would you prefer that?\u2019",
    "This was a warning. This was where his father drew the line. Everything Robin had done until now might still be forgiven, if he only backed down; if he only made his apologies, bent to authority, and returned to naive, ignorant luxury.",
    "The origins of the word anger were tied closely to physical suffering. Anger was first an \u2018affliction\u2019, as meant by the Old Icelandic angr, and then a \u2018painful, cruel, narrow\u2019 state, as meant by the Old English enge, which in turn came from the Latin angor, which meant \u2018strangling, anguish, distress\u2019. Anger was a chokehold. Anger did not empower you. It sat on your chest; it squeezed your ribs until you felt trapped, suffocated, out of options. Anger simmered, then exploded. Anger was constriction, and the consequent rage a desperate attempt to breathe.",
    "Afterwards, Robin wondered often if Professor Lovell had seen something in his eyes, a fire he hadn\u2019t known his son possessed, and whether that \u2013 his startled realization that his linguistic experiment had developed a will of his own \u2013 had prompted Robin in turn to act. He would try desperately to justify what he\u2019d done as self-defence, but such justification would rely on details he could hardly remember, details he wasn\u2019t sure whether he\u2019d made up to convince himself he had not really murdered his father in cold blood.",
    "Professor Lovell stood abruptly. His hand went to his pocket. And Robin, either mirroring or provoking him, did the same. He reached for his front pocket, where he kept the bar that had killed Eveline Brooke. He was not imagining what the bar might do \u2013 of this he was certain. He spoke the match-pair because they were the only words that came to mind to describe this moment, its immensity. He thought of Professor Lovell\u2019s poker cracking over and over against his ribs as he lay curled on the library floor, too startled and confused to cry out.",
    "He thought of Griffin, poor Griffin, spirited to England at a younger age than he\u2019d been; chewed up and thrown away because he didn\u2019t remember enough of his native tongue. He thought of the listless men in the opium den. He thought of his mother..",
    "He was not thinking of how the bar would claw apart his father\u2019s chest. Some part of him must have known, of course, because words only activated the bars if you meant them. If you only uttered the syllables, they had no effect. And when he saw the character in his mind, saw the grooves etched in shining silver, and spoke the word and its translation out loud, he must have thought of what it would do.",
    "He did not know what made him say it, the word for father. Perhaps he thought it would stun Professor Lovell, that the shock alone would bring him back to life, that he could yank his father\u2019s soul back to his body by naming the one thing that they had never named. But Professor Lovell was limp, gone, and no matter how hard Robin shook him the blood would not stop pouring.",
    "\u2018Di\u0113,\u2019 he said again. Then a laugh escaped his throat; hysterical, helpless, because it was so very funny, so apt that the romanization of father contained the same letters for death in English. And Professor Lovell was so clearly, incontrovertibly dead. There was no walking back from this. There could be no more pretending.",
    "Someone banged at the door. Dazed, without thinking, Robin stood and unlatched it. Ramy, Letty, and Victoire came tumbling in, a babble of voices \u2013 \u2018Oh, Robin, are you\u2014\u2019; \u2018What\u2019s happening\u2014\u2019; \u2018We heard shouting, we thought\u2014\u2019",
    "\u2018We quarrelled.\u2019 Robin could barely get the words out. He was struggling now to breathe. Black pressed in at the edges of his vision. His knees felt very weak, and he wanted badly to sit down, only the floor was drenched in a spreading pool of blood. \u2018We quarrelled, and . . .\u2019",
    "No one obeyed. They all stood frozen in place, gazes locked on Professor Lovell\u2019s still form as Ramy knelt beside him and held two fingers against his neck. A long moment passed. Ramy murmured a prayer under his breath \u2013 \u2018Inna lillahi wa inna ilayhi Raji\u2019un\u2019 \u2013 and then moved his hands over Professor Lovell\u2019s eyelids to push them closed.",
    "\u2018There is, first of all,\u2019 I said, \u2018the greatest lie about the things of greatest concernment, which was no pretty invention of him who told how Uranus did what Hesiod says he did to Cronos, and how Cronos in turn took his revenge; and then there are the doings and sufferings of Cronos at the hands of his son. Even if they were true I should not think that they ought to be thus lightly told to thoughtless young persons.\u2019",
    "\u2018Keep him in the cabin,\u2019 Victoire said with amazing composure, though the words that came out of her mouth were quite mad. \u2018We\u2019ll just . . . roll him up in those sheets and keep him out of sight until we get back to England\u2014\u2019",
    "Robin was stunned that their first instinct was to discuss how to hide the body. It didn\u2019t change the fact that he\u2019d just killed his father, or that he\u2019d possibly implicated all of them in the murder, or that scarlet streaked the walls, the floor, his neck, and his hands. But they were talking as if this were only a matter to be fixed \u2013 a thorny translation that could be resolved, if they could only find the right turn of phrase.",
    "\u2018All right, look \u2013 here\u2019s what we\u2019ll do.\u2019 Victoire pushed her palms against her temples and took a deep breath. \u2018We\u2019ll get rid of the body somehow. I don\u2019t know how, we\u2019ll figure out a way. Then when we dock\u2014\u2019",
    "\u2018How\u2019s this?\u2019 asked Victoire. \u2018We\u2019ll tell them he\u2019s got some contagion. I don\u2019t know, some \u2013 some scary disease \u2013 Robin, you come up with something exotic and disgusting that will scare them off. Say it\u2019s something he picked up in the slums and they\u2019ll all be too scared to come in.\u2019",
    "\u2018Fine.\u2019 Ramy had begun pacing back and forth across the small stretch of wooden floorboards that weren\u2019t covered with blood. \u2018Oh, heavens \u2013 Allah forgive us.\u2019 He rubbed at his eyes. \u2018Fine, yes, that could work. Suppose we keep this a secret until we\u2019re back in London. What then?\u2019",
    "\u2018Easy,\u2019 said Victoire. \u2018We\u2019ll say he died during the journey. During his sleep, perhaps. Only we can\u2019t have the ship\u2019s doctor coming to do an autopsy, because the risk of contamination is too great. We\u2019ll ask for a coffin, which we\u2019ll stuff a bunch of \u2013 I don\u2019t know, books rolled up in clothes \u2013 and then we\u2019ll carry it off and get rid of it.\u2019",
    "Letty was silent for a moment. Robin was absolutely sure she would insist they turn themselves in, but then she threw up her hands and said, \u2018We could just tip him overboard in broad daylight, say he accidentally drowned, and then they\u2019ll all have seen him die so we won\u2019t seem suspicious\u2014\u2019",
    "\u2018Oh, and that\u2019s not suspicious?\u2019 asked Ramy. \u2018We\u2019ll just drag this bloody corpse up above deck, pretend it\u2019s walking on its own, and then hurl it into the waves where anyone can see that gaping hole where his heart should be? That\u2019s how we prove our innocence? Have some creativity, Letty, we\u2019ve got to play this right\u2014\u2019",
    "At last Robin found his tongue. \u2018No. No, this is mad, I can\u2019t let \u2013 You all can\u2019t\u2014\u2019 He kept tripping over his words. He took a deep breath, stilled his tongue. \u2018I did this. I\u2019ll tell the captain, I\u2019ll turn myself in, and that\u2019s it.\u2019",
    "\u2018We\u2019re all implicated regardless,\u2019 said Victoire. \u2018We\u2019re all foreigners returning from a foreign country on a ship with a dead white man.\u2019 This statement excluded Letty, but no one corrected her. \u2018There is no world in which you go to prison and the rest of us walk free. You see this, right? Either we protect you, or we damn ourselves.\u2019",
    "\u2018No, I want to be here,\u2019 said Letty. \u2018I want to know what happens next. I can\u2019t just let you all . . . No.\u2019 She squeezed her eyes shut and shook her head, then reopened her eyes and announced very slowly, as if she\u2019d just come to the decision, \u2018I\u2019m in this. With you. All of you.\u2019",
    "\u2018Good,\u2019 Ramy said briskly. He wiped his hands on his trousers, then resumed his pacing. \u2018Now, here\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking. We aren\u2019t supposed to be on this packet. We were originally scheduled to return on the fourth, remember? No one\u2019s expecting us back before then, which means nobody will be looking for him when we disembark.\u2019",
    "\u2018Right.\u2019 Victoire nodded, then picked up his train of thought. It was quite frightening, watching the two of them. They grew more confident as they spoke. It was as if they were simply collaborating on a group translation, playing off each other\u2019s brilliance. \u2018It\u2019s clear the easiest way to get caught is for someone to glimpse the body. So our first priority, as I said, should be to get rid of it as soon as possible \u2013 as soon as it\u2019s dark outside. Then, for the rest of the voyage, we\u2019ll tell everyone he\u2019s ill.",
    "No one\u2019s more afraid of foreign diseases than sailors, isn\u2019t that right? The moment we let slip that he\u2019s down with something that they might catch, I guarantee you no one will approach that door for weeks. Which means all we\u2019ve got to worry about is getting him into the water.\u2019.",
    "Madness, Robin thought. This was madness, and he couldn\u2019t understand why no one was laughing, why everyone seemed to be very seriously contemplating the idea of dragging their professor\u2019s body up two flights of stairs and hurling it into the sea. They were all past the point of incredulity. The shock had worn off, and the surreal had become the practical. They were speaking not in terms of ethics, but of logistics, and this made Robin feel as if they\u2019d stepped into an upside-down world where nothing made sense, and no one had a single problem with it but him.",
    "\u2018I \u2013 well, I suppose that works, I just . . .\u2019 He shook his head. There was a very loud ringing in his ears, and it made it hard for him to collect his thoughts. \u2018Sorry, I just . . . aren\u2019t any of you going to ask me why?\u2019",
    "\u2018It\u2019s just \u2013 you\u2019re all signed up to help me conceal a murder?\u2019 Robin couldn\u2019t help all his statements becoming questions. The whole world right then seemed like one great, unanswerable question. \u2018And you\u2019re not even going to ask how, or why?\u2019",
    "Ramy and Victoire exchanged a look. But it was Letty who answered first. \u2018I think we all understand why.\u2019 Her throat pulsed. He could not decipher the expression on her face \u2013 it was something he\u2019d never seen on her before, some strange mixture of pity and resolve. \u2018And to be honest, Robin, I think the less we say about it the better.\u2019",
    "Cleaning up the cabin went faster than Robin had feared. Letty secured a mop and bucket from the crew by claiming she\u2019d vomited from seasickness, and the rest of them contributed several articles of clothing to soak up the bloody water.",
    "Then there was the matter of disposal. They decided that shoving Professor Lovell in a trunk was their best chance at getting his body to the upper deck unquestioned. The migration upstairs was a game of bated breaths and progress in inches. Victoire would dart forward every few seconds, check to make sure there was no one in sight, and then motion frantically for Robin and Ramy to drag the trunk up another few steps. Letty kept guard on the top deck, feigning a nighttime stroll for some fresh air.",
    "\u2018All right.\u2019 Robin slid the lid off the trunk. Originally they\u2019d considered throwing the whole trunk away, but Victoire had astutely pointed out that wood would float. He was afraid to look down; he wanted, if possible, to do this without looking at his father\u2019s face. \u2018Quickly, before anyone sees\u2014\u2019",
    "At last he found a pile of rope knotted through with what looked like weights. He prayed it wasn\u2019t needed for anything important and dragged it over to the trunk. Securing the rope around Professor Lovell was a nightmare. His heavy, stiffening limbs did not move easily; the corpse seemed in fact to be actively resisting them. The rope, horrifically, snagged on exposed and jagged ribs. Robin\u2019s hands, sweaty with fear, kept slipping; several agonizing minutes passed before they got the rope snugly around the professor\u2019s arms and legs.",
    "Now, Ramy instructed, they simply went back to their bunks and acted normal for the rest of the voyage. Simple, in theory. But of all the places to commit a murder, a ship midvoyage had to be one of the worst. A killer on the street could at least drop his weapon and flee the city. But they were stuck for two more months at the scene of the crime, two months during which they had to maintain the fiction that they had not blown a man\u2019s chest apart and dumped his body into the ocean.",
    "They tried to keep up appearances. They took their daily strolls around the deck, they entertained Miss Smythe and her tiresome inquiries, and they appeared for meals in the mess, thrice a day on the clock, trying their best to work up an appetite.",
    "\u2018He\u2019s just feeling under the weather,\u2019 Ramy answered when the cook asked why he hadn\u2019t seen Professor Lovell for several days. \u2018He says he\u2019s not very hungry \u2013 some kind of stomach affliction \u2013 but we\u2019ll bring him something to eat later.\u2019",
    "\u2018Oh, it\u2019s a whole host of minor symptoms,\u2019 Ramy lied smoothly. \u2018He\u2019s complained of a headache, some congestion, but it\u2019s mostly nausea. He gets dizzy if he stands up for too long, so he\u2019s spending most of his days in bed. Sleeping quite a lot. Could be seasickness, although he didn\u2019t have any problems with it on the way over.\u2019",
    "Luckily, none of the rest of the crew ever questioned Professor Lovell\u2019s whereabouts. The sailors were none too fascinated by the daily dealings of scholars they\u2019d been paid a pittance to transport; they were more than happy to pretend they did not exist at all. Miss Smythe was a different story. She was, likely out of sheer boredom, desperately persistent in making herself useful. She asked incessantly about Professor Lovell\u2019s fever, the sound of his cough, and colour and composition of his stool. \u2018I\u2019ve seen my share of tropical diseases,\u2019 she said.",
    "Somehow they convinced her that Professor Lovell was both highly contagious and painfully shy. (\u2018He won\u2019t be alone with an unmarried woman,\u2019 Letty vowed solemnly. \u2018He\u2019ll be furious if we let you in there.\u2019) Still, Miss Smythe insisted that they join her in a daily prayer for his health, during which it took Robin all he had not to retch from guilt.",
    "The days were terribly long. Time crawled when every second contained a horrible contingency, the question will we get away? Robin was constantly sick. His nausea was wholly different from the roiling unease of seasickness; it was a vicious mass of guilt gnawing at his stomach and clawing at his throat, a poisonous weight that made it hard to breathe. Trying to relax or to distract himself was no help; it was when he slipped up and lost his guard that the sickness redoubled.",
    "Behaving like a person demanded tremendous focus. Sometimes the most he could do was to remember to breathe, hard and even. He had to scream a mantra in his mind \u2013 it\u2019s all right, it\u2019s all right, you\u2019re all right, they don\u2019t know, they think you\u2019re just a student and they think he\u2019s just sick \u2013 but even that mantra threatened to spin out of control; if he relaxed his focus for just one second, it morphed to the truth \u2013 you killed him, you blew a hole in his chest and his blood\u2019s all over the books, all over your hands, slick, wet, warm\u2014",
    "He was scared of his subconscious; of letting it wander. He could dwell on nothing. Every thought that passed through his mind spiralled into a chaotic jumble of guilt and horror; always solidified into the same bleak refrain:",
    "He tortured himself with imagining what might happen to them if they were caught. He projected the scenes so vividly they felt like memories \u2013 the short and damning trial, the disgusted looks from the jurors; the manacles around their wrists and, if not the gallows, then the long, crowded, miserable journey to a penal colony in Australia.",
    "What he couldn\u2019t wrap his mind around was what a truly fleeting moment the actual killing had been \u2013 no more than a split second of impulsive hatred, a single uttered phrase, a single throw. The Analects of Confucius made the claim s\u00ecb\u00f9j\u00edsh\u00e9;* that even a four-horse chariot could not catch a word once uttered, that the spoken word was irrevocable. But this seemed like a great trick of time. It did not seem fair that such a minuscule action could have such reverberating consequences.",
    "Something that broke not only his world but Ramy\u2019s, Letty\u2019s, and Victoire\u2019s should have taken minutes at least, it seemed; should have required repeated effort. The truth of the murder would have made more sense had he stood over his father\u2019s body with a blunt axe, bringing it down over and over into his skull and chest until blood sprayed across both their faces. Something brutal, something sustained, a true manifestation of monstrous intent..",
    "But that did not describe what had happened at all. It had not been vicious. It had not taken effort. It was all over so fast, he hadn\u2019t even had time to deliberate. He couldn\u2019t remember acting at all. Could you intend a murder if you couldn\u2019t remember wanting it?",
    "But what kind of question was that? What was the blasted point of sorting through whether he\u2019d desired his father\u2019s death or not, when his ruined corpse was incontrovertibly, irreversibly sinking to the bottom of the ocean?",
    "The nights were far worse than the days. At least the days offered the temporary distractions of the outdoors, the rolling ocean and spraying mists. At night, confined to his hammock, there was only the unforgiving dark. Nights meant sweat-drenched sheets, chills, and shakes, and not even the privacy to moan and scream out loud. Robin lay with his knees curled up to his chest, muffling his frantic breathing with both hands. When he managed snatches of sleep, his dreams were fragmented and horrifyingly vivid, revisiting every beat of that final conversation until the devastating finale.",
    "But the details kept changing. What were the last words Professor Lovell had said? How had he looked at Robin? Had he really stepped closer? Who had moved first? Was it self-defence, or was it a preemptive strike? Was there a difference? He wrecked his own memory. Awake and asleep, he examined the same moment from a thousand different angles until he truly no longer knew what had happened..",
    "He wanted all thoughts to stop. He wanted to disappear. At night, the black, endless waves seemed like utopia, and he wanted nothing more than to hurl himself over the side, to let the ocean swallow him and his guilt into its obliterating depths. But that would only condemn the others. How would that look, one student drowned and their professor killed? No excuses, however creative, however true, could extricate them from that.",
    "Robin tried to push past Ramy for the stairs. Ramy promptly slapped him across the face. Somehow this calmed him, if only due to shock \u2013 the blinding white pain wiped everything from his mind, just for a few seconds, just long enough to still his racing heart.",
    "\u2018We are all implicated now,\u2019 Ramy hissed. \u2018We cleaned that room. We hid the body for you. To protect you. We\u2019ve all lied a dozen times now; we are accessories in this crime, and if you go to the hangman, you doom us all. Do you understand?\u2019",
    "The only silver lining to this whole grotesque affair was that he and Ramy were finally reconciled. The act of murder had bridged the gap between them, had blown Ramy\u2019s accusations of complicity and cowardice out of the water. It didn\u2019t matter that it had been an accident, or that Robin would take it back immediately if he could. Ramy no longer had any ideological grounds to resent him, for between them, only one of them had killed a colonizer. They were co-conspirators now, and this brought them closer than they ever had been.",
    "Ramy took on the role of comforter and counsellor, witness to his confessions. Robin didn\u2019t know why he thought speaking his thoughts might make anything better, for saying any of it out loud only served to make him more confused, but he was desperately grateful that Ramy was at least there to listen..",
    "\u2018But I\u2019m a murderer,\u2019 he said, then said it again, because the words were so absurd that the very act of forming the vowels felt bizarre. \u2018I took a life. With full deliberation, with full intent \u2013 I knew what the bar would do to him and I threw it, and I watched it break his body, and in the moment before I regretted it, I was satisfied with what I had done. It wasn\u2019t an accident. It doesn\u2019t matter how much I wish I could take it back now \u2013 I wanted him dead, and I killed him.\u2019 He took a shuddering breath. \u2018Am I \u2013 what kind of person do you have to be to do that? A villain.",
    "\u2018But the Qu\u2019ran also speaks of Allah\u2019s infinite mercy.\u2019 Ramy was quiet for a moment. \u2018And I think . . . well, Professor Lovell was a very bad man, wasn\u2019t he? You acted in self-defence, didn\u2019t you? And the things he did to you, to your brother, to your mothers . . . perhaps he did deserve to die. Perhaps the fact that you killed him first prevented unforetold harm from coming to others. But that\u2019s really not your decision to make. That\u2019s God\u2019s.\u2019",
    "\u2018There\u2019s nothing you can do,\u2019 said Ramy. \u2018He\u2019s dead, you killed him, and there\u2019s nothing you can do to change that except pray to God for forgiveness.\u2019 He paused, tapping his fingers against his knee. \u2018But the question now is how to protect Victoire and Letty. And your turning yourself in doesn\u2019t do that, Birdie. Neither does your torturing yourself about your worth as a human being. Lovell\u2019s dead, and you\u2019re alive, and perhaps that\u2019s what God willed. And that\u2019s as much comfort as I can offer.\u2019",
    "The four of them took turns losing their minds. There was an unspoken rule to this game: one of them was allowed to break down at a time, but not all of them at once, for the duty of the saner heads was to talk the mad one down.",
    "Ramy\u2019s favourite way of panicking was to voice all his anxieties in extravagant, incredibly specific detail. \u2018Someone will go to his cabin,\u2019 he declared. \u2018They\u2019ll need to ask him a question \u2013 something inane, something about the arrival date or about payment for passage. Only he won\u2019t be there, and they\u2019ll ask us about it, and finally somebody will get suspicious and they\u2019ll search the whole ship, and we\u2019ll pretend we\u2019ve no idea where he\u2019s gone either and they won\u2019t believe us, and then they\u2019ll find the bloodstains\u2014\u2019",
    "\u2018Then they\u2019ll send us to Newgate,\u2019 Ramy continued, intoning grandly as if narrating an epic poem, \u2018and St Sepulchre\u2019s bell will ring twelve times, and a great crowd will gather outside, and the next morning we\u2019ll be hanged, one by one . . .\u2019",
    "The only way to get Ramy to stop was to let him finishing narrating the entire sick fantasy, which he always did, with more and more ludicrous descriptions of their executions every time. They actually brought Robin some relief \u2013 it was relaxing, in a way, to imagine the very worst that could happen, since it took the terror out of the unknown. But it only ever set Victoire off. Whenever these conversations occurred, she\u2019d be unable to sleep.",
    "Then it would be her turn to lose her head, and she\u2019d nudge them awake at four in the morning, whispering that she felt bad about keeping Letty up, and they would have to sit above deck with her, whispering inane stories about whatever came to mind \u2013 birdsong, Beethoven, departmental gossip \u2013 until the gentle reprieve of dawn..",
    "Letty\u2019s bad spells were the hardest to deal with. For Letty, alone among them, did not understand why Ramy and Victoire had come so readily to Robin\u2019s defence. She assumed they\u2019d protected Robin because they were friends. The one motive she understood was that she\u2019d seen Professor Lovell seize Robin\u2019s collar in Canton, and abusive fathers was something she and Robin had in common.",
    "But since she saw Professor Lovell\u2019s death as an isolated incident, not the tip of an iceberg, she was constantly trying to fix their situation. \u2018There have to be ways to come clean,\u2019 she kept saying. \u2018We can say Professor Lovell was hurting Robin, that it was self-defence? That he\u2019d lost his mind from stress, that he began it all, and that Robin was only trying to get away? We\u2019d all testify, it\u2019s all true, they\u2019d have to acquit him \u2013 Robin, what do you think?\u2019",
    "How could they tell her she was being delusional? That it was insane to imagine that the British legal system was truly neutral, that they would receive a fair trial, that people who looked like Robin, Ramy, and Victoire might kill a white Oxford professor, throw his body overboard, lie about it for weeks, and then walk away unscathed? That the fact that she clearly believed all this was only evidence of the starkly different worlds they lived in?",
    "But since they couldn\u2019t tell her the truth, Letty was undeterred. \u2018I\u2019ve got a new idea,\u2019 she announced after they shot down her self-defence proposal. \u2018So, as you all probably know, my father\u2019s quite an important man\u2014\u2019",
    "\u2018What kind of favours?\u2019 demanded Ramy. \u2018\u201cHello, Judge Blathers, here\u2019s the thing \u2013 my daughter and her dirty foreign friends have had their professor killed \u2013 a man crucial to the Empire, both financially and diplomatically \u2013 so when they\u2019re up for trial I\u2019ll need you to just go ahead and proclaim them innocent\u2014\u201d\u2019",
    "\u2018An accident?\u2019 Ramy repeated. \u2018Have you covered up accidents before? Do they just look the other way when rich white girls kill people? Is that how it works, Letty? Besides, aren\u2019t you on the outs with the admiral?\u2019",
    "Feigning Professor Lovell\u2019s illness throughout the journey had turned out to be simpler than even Victoire had expected; it was apparently very easy to convince an entire ship that an Oxford professor had a remarkably weak constitution. Jemima Smythe, for all her efforts, had finally grown tired of her clammed-up company, and made no efforts to draw out their parting. The sailors said hardly as much as a word of farewell when they disembarked.",
    "Robin was sure that everything they did screamed Murderers! as they lugged their trunks down the planks. Any moment now, he thought dizzily; one more step, and there it would be \u2013 a suspicious look, a flurry of footsteps, a call of \u2018Hey there! You, stop!\u2019 Surely they would not let them escape the Hellas so easily.",
    "On shore, just twelve feet away, was England, was asylum, was freedom. Once they reached that shore, once they disappeared into the crowd, they would be free. But that was impossible, surely \u2013 the links connecting them to that bloody room could not be so easily severed. Could they?",
    "They boarded an omnibus to north London, from which they hailed a cab to Hampstead. They\u2019d agreed without much debate that they would first spend the night at Professor Lovell\u2019s Hampstead residence upon arrival \u2013 they had got in too late to catch any trains to Oxford, and Robin knew both that Mrs Piper would still be in Jericho and that the spare key to the estate was hidden under the Ming flowerpot in the garden. The next morning they would board a train to Paddington and return to school as planned.",
    "During the voyage it had crossed all their minds that there remained one obvious option \u2013 running, dropping everything and fleeing the continent; climbing onto a packet bound for America or Australia, or returning to the countries from which they\u2019d been plucked.",
    "This was a good point, and one they\u2019d somehow overlooked. Years of receiving a reliable stipend had made them forget that they only ever had enough to live on for several months; outside Oxford, in a place where their lodgings and meals were no longer provided, they would have nothing.",
    "No, there was never any real possibility they would leave the university. Despite everything, despite the very real risk that if they went back to Oxford then they\u2019d be arrested, investigated, and thrown in prison or hanged, they couldn\u2019t conceive of a life not tied to the university. For they had nothing else. They had no skills; they had not the strength nor the temperament for manual labour, and they did not have the connections to find employment. Most importantly, they didn\u2019t know how to live.",
    "None of them had the faintest idea how much it would cost to rent rooms, acquire a week\u2019s worth of groceries, or set oneself up in a town that was not the university. Until now, all of that had been taken care of for them. In Hampstead, there had been Mrs Piper, and at Oxford, there were the scouts and bedmakers. Robin, indeed, would have been hard-pressed to explain how exactly one did the laundry..",
    "And though he knew it was stupid, Robin suspected he wasn\u2019t the only one who believed deep down that, despite everything, there was a world where once this trouble ended, once all necessary arrangements had been made and things were swept under the rug, he might still return to his room on Magpie Lane, might wake up to gentle birdsong and warm sunlight streaming through the narrow window, and once again spend his days poring over nothing but dead languages..",
    "To the assistance and information which you and Mr Jardine so handsomely afforded to us it was mainly owing that we were able to give our affairs naval, military and diplomatic, in China those detailed instructions which have led to these satisfactory results.",
    "It was raining hard when they climbed out of the cab in Hampstead. They found Professor Lovell\u2019s house more by sheer luck than anything else. Robin had thought he\u2019d easily remember the route, but three years away had done more to his memory than he\u2019d realized, and the hammering sheets of rain made every residence look the same: wet, blockish, surrounded by slick, dripping foliage. By the time they finally found the brick-and-white-stucco house, they were sopping wet and trembling.",
    "They glanced at each other, panicked; they had not discussed an answer for this occasion. They had wanted to avoid all association with a man whose absence would soon garner considerable interest. But how else could they justify their presence in Hampstead?",
    "\u2018We are,\u2019 Robin said quickly, before their silence became suspicious. \u2018We\u2019re his students. We\u2019re just back from overseas \u2013 he told us to meet him here when we returned, only it\u2019s getting late and no one\u2019s at the door.\u2019",
    "\u2018He\u2019s probably at the university.\u2019 The woman\u2019s expression was actually quite friendly; she\u2019d only seemed hostile because she\u2019d been shouting over the rain. \u2018He\u2019s only here a few weeks of the year. Stay right there.\u2019",
    "\u2018A good thing I was watching the rain, then.\u2019 She had a broad, friendly smile; any suspicion, if it ever was there, had disappeared from her face. \u2018I like to face the outside when I play my pianoforte. The world informs my music.\u2019",
    "\u2018Oh, it\u2019s nothing. Call if you need anything.\u2019 She nodded first to Robin, and then to Letty \u2013 she seemed not to even see Ramy or Victoire, for which Robin supposed they could only be grateful \u2013 and headed back across the street.",
    "\u2018Mrs Piper wrote about her,\u2019 said Robin as he dragged his trunk up through the front garden. \u2018Said a new family\u2019s moved in, and that the wife is a lonely and eccentric type. I think she comes here most afternoons for tea when the professor is here.\u2019",
    "Robin had not been back to the house in Hampstead since he\u2019d left for Oxford, and it seemed greatly changed in his absence. It was a good deal smaller than he\u2019d remembered, or perhaps he\u2019d just grown taller. The staircase was not such an endless spiral, and the high ceilings did not induce such a heavy sense of solitude. It was very dim inside; all the curtains were drawn, and sheets pulled over the furniture to protect it from dust. They groped around in the dark for a bit \u2013 Mrs Piper had always lit the lamps and candles, and Robin hadn\u2019t a clue where she kept the matches.",
    "He meant the chinoiserie. Robin glanced around. The parlour was filled with painted fans, hanging scrolls, and porcelain vases, sculptures, and teapots. The effect was a garish re-creation of a Canton teahouse juxtaposed upon a base of English furniture. Had these always been there? Robin didn\u2019t know how he had failed to notice as a child. Perhaps, fresh from Canton, he had not found the separation of two worlds so obvious; perhaps it was only now, after a full immersion in the most English of universities, that he\u2019d developed a sharper sense of the foreign and the exotic.",
    "An expedition to the kitchens turned up nothing to eat. Mrs Piper wouldn\u2019t have stocked provisions while she was still at the Oxford house. The Hampstead house had a persistent rat problem, Robin recalled, never resolved because Professor Lovell abhorred cats, and Mrs Piper hated leaving perishables at their mercy. Ramy found a tin of ground coffee and a jar of salt, but no sugar. They made and drank the coffee anyway. It only sharpened their hunger, but at least it kept them alert.",
    "They had just washed and dried their empty mugs \u2013 Robin didn\u2019t know why they were cleaning up when the owner of this place would never come home, but it still felt wrong to leave a mess \u2013 when they heard a sharp knock at the door. They all jumped. The knocker paused, then rapped again firmly, thrice in succession.",
    "Their kindly neighbour stood sopping wet on the doorstep, carrying a flimsy, ineffective umbrella in one hand and a covered basket in the other. \u2018I noticed you hadn\u2019t brought provisions. He always leaves the pantry empty when he\u2019s gone \u2013 rat problem.\u2019",
    "When he said nothing else, she held the basket out towards him. \u2018I\u2019ve just asked my girl Fanny to cobble together what we had on hand. There\u2019s some wine, a hard and a soft cheese, this morning\u2019s bread \u2013 crusty, I\u2019m afraid \u2013 and some olives and sardines. If you want bread fresh baked, you\u2019ll have to try again in the morning, but let me know if you do want to come over so I can have Fanny send for more fresh butter, we\u2019re nearly out.\u2019",
    "Robin wasn\u2019t sure what to say. He felt vaguely that the less of an oral trail they left, the better \u2013 he\u2019d already told the captain that Professor Lovell had gone ahead of them, and they intended to tell the Babel faculty that Professor Lovell was still in Hampstead, so it might be very dangerous should Mrs Clemens present a different account entirely. But who was going to question all three parties? If the police had got that far, wouldn\u2019t the four of them already be detained?",
    "Letty came to his rescue. \u2018Could be as soon as Monday,\u2019 she said, nudging him aside. \u2018But we heard at the docks that his ship might be delayed \u2013 bad weather over the Atlantic, you know \u2013 so it could be weeks still.\u2019",
    "They devoured the cheese and olives in seconds. The bread was hard and took some chewing, which slowed them down, but in minutes that was gone as well. Then they eyed the wine bottle with great longing, caught between knowing they should stay on their guard and wanting desperately to be drunk, until Ramy took responsibility and hid it in the pantry.",
    "By then it was half past eleven. At Oxford, all of them would be awake for hours yet, poring over their assignments or laughing in each other\u2019s rooms. But they were all exhausted, and too scared to part ways to separate bedrooms, so they searched the house for all the blankets and pillows they could find and piled them in the sitting room.",
    "They decided to sleep in shifts, with one person always awake to keep watch. None of them really believed that the police might come crashing through the doors \u2013 and never mind that there was little they could do about it if that did happen \u2013 but it felt good to be at least minimally prudent.",
    "Robin volunteered to go first. At first none of them could keep still, all jittery from coffee and nerves, but soon fatigue got the better of them, and in minutes their murmured anxieties gave way to deep, even breathing. Letty and Victoire were slumped together on the couch, Victoire\u2019s head on Letty\u2019s arm. Ramy slept on the floor beside Robin, body curled around the couch like protective parenthesis. The sight of them all together made Robin\u2019s chest ache.",
    "He waited half an hour, watching their chests rise and fall, before he dared to stand up. He reasoned it was safe to leave his post. If anything happened, he\u2019d hear it across the house \u2013 the rain had now eased to a light patter, and the house was otherwise deathly silent. Holding his breath, he tiptoed out of the sitting room and up the stairs to Professor Lovell\u2019s office.",
    "It was just as cramped and messy as he remembered. At Oxford, Professor Lovell kept his office in some semblance of order, but at home he let his things devolve to a state of managed chaos. Loose papers lay strewn across the floor; books were stacked in piles around the shelves, some lying open, some shut around pens crammed inside to mark the pages.",
    "Robin picked his way across the room to Professor Lovell\u2019s desk. He\u2019d never stood behind it; he\u2019d only ever sat across it, hands clasped nervously in his lap. The desk seemed unrecognizable from the other side. A framed painting was propped upright on the right corner \u2013 no, not a painting, a daguerreotype. Robin tried not to look closely, but he couldn\u2019t help but glimpse the outline of a dark-haired woman and two children. He turned the frame down.",
    "He flipped through the loose papers on the desk. They were nothing interesting \u2013 notes on Tang dynasty poems and oracle bone inscriptions, both research projects Robin had known Professor Lovell was pursuing at Oxford. He tried the drawer on the right. He expected it to be locked, but it slid open with no trouble. Stashed inside were sheafs and sheafs of letters. He pulled them out and held them up to the lamplight one by one, unsure what he was looking for, or even what he expected to see.",
    "Most of Professor Lovell\u2019s correspondence was with Babel faculty and representatives of the various trading companies \u2013 a handful with the East India Company, more from representatives with Magniac & Co., but the lion\u2019s share were from men at Jardine & Matheson. These were quite interesting. He read faster and faster as he made his way through the pile, skimming over opening niceties for critical phrases buried in the middle paragraphs\u2014\u2013",
    ". . . G\u00fctzlaff\u2019s blockade might work . . . would only take thirteen warships, though the question is the time and expense . . . Simple show of force . . . Lindsay wants to embarrass them with a diplomatic withdrawal, but surely this endangers the sole customs agents left behind . . . bring them to the edge and they will back down . . . can\u2019t be hard to decimate a fleet run by sailors who don\u2019t even know what steamers are . . .",
    "Two things were clear. First, there was no ambiguity what these documents were. A letter from Reverend G\u00fctzlaff from four months ago contained a detailed sketch of Canton\u2019s main docks. On the other side was a list of all the known ships in the Chinese navy. These were not hypotheticals of Britain\u2019s China policy. These were war plans.",
    "These letters included thorough accounts of the Qing government\u2019s coastal defences, reports detailing the number of junks defending the naval stations, the number and placement of forts on the surrounding islands, and even the precise number of troops stationed at each..",
    "Second, Professor Lovell\u2019s voice emerged as one of the most hawkish among his interlocutors. Initially, Robin had conceived a silly, baseless hope that perhaps this war was not Professor Lovell\u2019s idea, and that perhaps he had been urging them to stop. But Professor Lovell was quite vocal, not only on the many benefits of such a war (including the vast linguistic resources that would then be at his disposal), but about the ease with which the \u2018Chinese, languid and lazy, with an army without one iota of bravery or discipline, might be defeated\u2019.",
    "His father had not simply been a scholar caught up in trade hostilities. He had helped design them. One unsent missive, written in Professor Lovell\u2019s neat, tiny hand and addressed to Lord Palmerston, read:.",
    "The Chinese fleet consists of outdated junks whose cannons are too small to aim effectively. The Chinese have only one ship worthy of combat against our fleet, the merchantman the Cambridge, purchased from the Americans, but they have no sailors that can handle her. Our agents report she sits idle in the bay. We will make short work of her with the Nemesis.",
    "Robin\u2019s heart was beating very quickly. He felt seized by a sudden urge to discover all he could, to determine the full extent of this conspiracy. He read frantically through the stack; when the letters ran out, he pulled another pile of correspondence from the left drawer. It revealed much of the same. The desirability of war was never a question, only its timing, and the difficulty of persuading Parliament to act. But some of these letters dated as far back as 1837. How had Jardine, Matheson, and Lovell known negotiations in Canton would break out in hostilities more than two years ago?",
    "But that was obvious. They\u2019d known because this was their intent all along. They wanted hostilities because they wanted silver, and without some miraculous change in the Qing Emperor\u2019s mind, the only way to get that was to turn their guns on China. They\u2019d planned on war before they had even set sail. They\u2019d never meant to negotiate with Commissioner Lin in good faith. Those talks were merely a pretext for hostilities. Those men had funded Professor Lovell\u2019s trip to Canton as a final expedition before they introduced the bill to Parliament.",
    "\u2018They\u2019re war plans,\u2019 said Robin. \u2018Everyone\u2019s in on it, everyone we met in Canton \u2013 look, here are letters from Reverends Morrison and G\u00fctzlaff \u2013 they\u2019ve been using their covers as missionaries to spy on the Qing military. G\u00fctzlaff\u2019s even been bribing informants to tell him particulars of Chinese troop deployment, which influential Chinese traders are against the British, and even which pawnshops would be good places to raid.\u2019",
    "\u2018There are also pamphlets to whip up public support for the war \u2013 look, here Matheson calls the Chinese \u201ca people characterized by a marvellous degree of imbecility, avarice, conceit, and obstinacy\u201d. And here someone called Goddard writes that deploying warships would be a \u201ctranquil and judicious visit\u201d. Imagine. A tranquil and judicious visit. What a way to describe a violent invasion.\u2019",
    "\u2018Because they still needed a pretext,\u2019 said Robin. It was falling into place now. It was all so clear, so ridiculously simple that he wanted to kick himself for not seeing it earlier. \u2018Because they still needed something to take to Parliament to prove the only way they were going to get what they wanted was by sheer force. They wanted Baylis to humiliate Lin, not compromise with him. They wanted to bait Lin into declaring hostilities first.\u2019",
    "Oxford was the answer. Oxford, which was what they\u2019d all agreed on, because when they\u2019d been trapped on the Hellas, their professor\u2019s corpse sinking into the depths of the ocean behind them, the promise of a return to the normal and familiar was what kept them calm, a shared delusion of stability that kept them from going mad. All their planning had always stopped at their safe arrival in England. But they couldn\u2019t keep skirting the issue, couldn\u2019t keep up the blind and ridiculous faith that if they just got back to Oxford, then everything would be all right.",
    "There was no going back. They all knew it. There was no pretending anymore, no hiding in their supposedly safe corner of the world while unimaginable cruelty and exploitation carried on beyond. There was only the vast, frightening web of the colonial empire, and the demands of justice to resist it.",
    "It seemed so obvious when she said it. Only Hermes might know what to do with this. The Hermes Society, which Robin had betrayed, which might not even be willing to take them back, was the only entity they\u2019d encountered that had ever professed to bother with the problem of colonialism. Here was a way out, a rare and undeserved second chance to make good on wrong choices \u2013 if only they could find Hermes before the police found them.",
    "Ramy scoffed. \u2018We\u2019ve been over this, over and over and over. You turn yourself in and what? Forget that Jardine and Matheson are trying to start a war? This is bigger than us now, Birdie. Bigger than you. You\u2019ve got obligations.\u2019",
    "\u2018You want to do the right thing,\u2019 said Ramy, bullish. \u2018You always do. But you think the right thing is martyrdom. You think if you suffer enough for whatever sins you\u2019ve committed, then you\u2019re absolved.\u2019",
    "\u2018That\u2019s why you took the fall for us that night. Every time you come up against something difficult, you just want to make it go away, and you think the way to do that is self-flagellation. You\u2019re obsessed with punishment. But that\u2019s not how this works, Birdie. You going to prison fixes nothing. You hanging from the gallows fixes nothing. The world\u2019s still broken. A war\u2019s still coming. The only way to properly make amends is to stop it, which you don\u2019t want to do, because really what this is about is your being afraid.\u2019",
    "\u2018You were trying to let yourself off the hook,\u2019 Ramy said, not unkindly. \u2018But all sacrifice does is make you feel better. It doesn\u2019t help the rest of us, so it\u2019s an ultimately meaningless gesture. Now, if you\u2019re finished with grand attempts at martyrdom, I think we should discuss . . .\u2019",
    "He trailed off. Victoire and Ramy followed his gaze to the door, where Letty stood, hands clutched against her chest. None of them knew how long she\u2019d been there. Her face had gone very pale, save for two blotches of colour high on her cheeks.",
    "Letty had been repeating this for the last ten minutes at regular intervals. It didn\u2019t matter how they explained it \u2013 the necessity of the Hermes Society, and the myriad reasons why such an organization had to exist in the shadows \u2013 she kept shaking her head, her eyes blank and uncomprehending. She didn\u2019t seem outraged or upset so much as truly baffled, as if they were trying to convince her that the sky was green. \u2018I don\u2019t understand. Weren\u2019t you happy at Babel?\u2019",
    "\u2018You\u2019ve made that abundantly clear,\u2019 Ramy snapped. \u2018You\u2019re a proper little princess, aren\u2019t you? Big estate in Brighton, summers in Toulouse, porcelain china on your shelves and Assam in your teacups? How could you understand? Your people reap the fruits of the Empire. Ours don\u2019t. So shut up, Letty, and just listen to what we\u2019re trying to tell you. It\u2019s not right what they\u2019re doing to our countries.\u2019 His voice grew louder, harder.",
    "\u2018And it\u2019s not right that I\u2019m trained to use my languages for their benefit, to translate laws and texts to facilitate their rule, when there are people in India and China and Haiti and all over the Empire and the world who are hungry and starving because the British would rather put silver in their hats and harpsichords than anywhere it could do some good.\u2019.",
    "Letty took this better than Robin thought she would. She sat in silence for a moment, blinking, her eyes huge. Then her brows furrowed, and she asked, \u2018But . . . but if inequality is the issue, then couldn\u2019t you have gone through the university? There are all sorts of aid programmes, missionary groups. There\u2019s philanthropy, you know, why couldn\u2019t we just go to the colonial governments and\u2014\u2019",
    "\u2018But that\u2019s not true,\u2019 said Letty. \u2018They contribute to charity all the time, I know, Professor Leblanc was leading research into London\u2019s waterworks so that the tenement housing wouldn\u2019t be so diseased, and there are humanitarian societies all over the globe\u2014\u2019*",
    "\u2018Capitale,\u2019 Victoire said. \u2018The Latin capitale, derived from caput, becomes the Old French chatel, which in English becomes chattel. Livestock and property become wealth. They write that on the bars, daisy-chain it with the word cattle, and then they fix those bars to iron chains so that slaves can\u2019t escape. You know how? It makes them docile. Like animals.\u2019",
    "\u2018And you think they just stopped?\u2019 Victoire made a noise that was half laugh, half sob. \u2018You don\u2019t think we sell bars to America? You think British manufacturers don\u2019t still profit from shackles and irons? You don\u2019t think there are people who still keep slaves in England who simply manage to hide it well?\u2019",
    "\u2018That\u2019s exactly the kind of thing Babel scholars do,\u2019 Victoire said viciously. \u2018I should know. It\u2019s the kind of thing our supervisor was working on. Every time I met with Leblanc he\u2019d change the subject to his precious chattel bars. He said he thought I might have special insight. He even asked once if I would put them on. He said he wanted to make sure it worked on Negroes.\u2019",
    "\u2018Letty, I tried.\u2019 Victoire\u2019s voice broke. There was such pain in her eyes. And it made Robin deeply ashamed, for only now did he see the cruel pattern of their friendship. Robin had always had Ramy. But at the end of the day, when they parted ways, Victoire only had Letty, who professed always to love her, to absolutely adore her, but who failed to hear anything she was saying if it didn\u2019t comport with how she already saw the world.",
    "And where were he and Ramy? Looking away, failing to notice, hoping secretly the girls would simply stop bickering and move on. Occasionally Ramy made jabs at Letty, but only for his own satisfaction. Never had either of them paused to consider how deeply alone Victoire had to have felt, all this time.",
    "Letty, Robin thought, was close to a breaking point. She was running out of arguments. She had the look of a dog backed into a corner. But her eyes darted around, desperately seeking an escape. She would find any flimsy excuse, accept any convoluted alternative logic before she let go of her illusions.",
    "\u2018But why?\u2019 Letty persisted. \u2018Why involve them? We should just do this ourselves. We should make pamphlets, we should go to Parliament \u2013 there are a thousand options we\u2019ve got other than going through some . . . some secret ring of thieves. This degree of collusion, of corruption \u2013 if the public just knew, they wouldn\u2019t possibly be for it, I\u2019m certain. But operating underground, stealing from the university \u2013 that only hurts your cause, doesn\u2019t it? Why can\u2019t you simply go public?\u2019",
    "\u2018The Quakers presented the first antislavery petition to Parliament in 1783,\u2019 said Victoire. \u2018Equiano published his memoir in 1789. Add that to the countless slave stories the abolitionists were telling the British public \u2013 stories of the cruellest, most awful tortures you can inflict on a fellow human. Because the mere fact that Black people were denied their freedom was not enough. They needed to see how grotesque it was. And even then, it took them decades to finally outlaw the trade. And that\u2019s slavery. Compared to that, a war in Canton over trade rights is going to look like nothing.",
    "It\u2019s not romantic. There are no novelists penning sagas about the effects of opium addiction on Chinese families. If Parliament votes to force Canton\u2019s ports open, it\u2019s going to look like free trade working as it should. So don\u2019t tell me that the British public, if they knew, would do anything at all.\u2019.",
    "Letty was quiet for a long time. She looked pitiful, stricken and frail, as if she\u2019d just been informed of a death in the family. She loosed a long, shaky breath and cast her eyes about each one of them in turn. \u2018I see why you never told me.\u2019",
    "But she stopped there. It was clear Victoire could not think of anything more reassuring to say. There was nothing more to say at all, except the truth, which was that of course they wouldn\u2019t have trusted her. That for all their history, for all their declarations of eternal friendship, they had no way of knowing which side she would take.",
    "\u2018Our minds are made up,\u2019 Victoire said gently, but firmly. \u2018We\u2019re taking this to Hermes, as soon as we arrive in Oxford. And you don\u2019t have to go with us \u2013 we can\u2019t force you to take that risk; we know you\u2019ve suffered so much already. But if you\u2019re not with us, then we ask you at least to keep our secrets.\u2019",
    "Ramy and Robin watched, unsure what to make of this. On someone else it would have been performative, sickening even, but with Letty, they knew it was not a charade. Letty could not cry on command; she could not even fake basic emotions on command. She was too stiff, too transparent; they knew she was unable to act in any way other than how she felt. So it did feel cathartic, seeing her break down like this, knowing that at last she understood how they all felt. It was a relief to see that in her they still had an ally.",
    "Still, something did not seem right, and Robin could tell from Victoire\u2019s and Ramy\u2019s faces that they thought so too. It took him a moment to realize what it was that grated on him, and when he did, it would bother him constantly, now and thereafter; it would seem a great paradox, the fact that after everything they had told Letty, all the pain they had shared, she was the one who needed comfort.",
    "Their return to Oxford the next morning quickly spiralled into a comedy of errors, much of which could have been avoided if they hadn\u2019t been too exhausted or hungry or irritated with each other to communicate. Their purses were running low, so they spent an hour arguing over whether it was prudent to borrow Mrs Clemens\u2019s carriage to Paddington Station until they gave up and forked over the fare for cabs. But cabs in Hampstead were hard to come by on Sunday mornings, which meant they didn\u2019t reach the station until ten minutes after the Oxford train had departed.",
    "They whiled away the hours in London, migrating from coffeehouse to coffeehouse so as not to attract suspicion, growing ever more twitchy and paranoid from the absurd amounts of coffee and sweets they bought to justify keeping their tables. Every now and then one of them would bring up Professor Lovell, or Hermes, only to be shushed viciously by the others; they didn\u2019t know who could be listening, and the whole of London felt full of hostile eavesdroppers.",
    "That was cruel, but Robin sympathized. Letty was wearing on him as well; she\u2019d spent most of the day in hysterics, and he was sick of it. All of their nerves were shot, he thought nastily, and Letty should just chin up and keep it together like the rest of them.",
    "At last, their train creaked into Oxford Station. Yawning and shivering, they lugged their trunks over bumpy cobblestones for the twenty minutes it took to walk back to the college \u2013 the girls would come to the porter\u2019s lodge first to call a cab, they\u2019d decided; it was too dark to walk so far up north alone. At last the austere stone face of University College emerged from the dark, and Robin felt a sharp pang of nostalgia at the sight of this magical and tainted place which, despite everything, still felt like home.",
    "Robin wondered how they looked under the lamplight \u2013 panicked, ragged, and sweaty in yesterday\u2019s clothes. Their exhaustion must have been obvious, for Billings\u2019s expression changed to one of pity. \u2018Oh, you poor dears.\u2019 He turned and waved for them to follow. \u2018Come with me.\u2019",
    "Fifteen minutes later they were seated around a table in the hall, huddled over cups of strong black tea while Billings fussed around in the kitchen. They\u2019d protested they didn\u2019t want to put him out of the way, but he\u2019d insisted on cooking them a proper fry-up. Soon he emerged with plates of sizzling eggs, sausages, potatoes, and toast.",
    "\u2018And something to lift the spirits.\u2019 Billings set four mugs down in front of them. \u2018Just some brandy and water. You\u2019re not the first Babblers I\u2019ve seen back from abroad. That\u2019s always done the trick.\u2019",
    "Letty shook her head. She bit her lip, but a whining noise burst out. It was not a mere sniffle but a stormy, full-body cry. She clamped her hands over her face and sobbed heartily, shoulders quaking, incoherent words leaking through her fingers.",
    "He went out to wake the driver. Ten minutes later a cab pulled up to the hall, and the girls were off to their lodgings. Robin and Ramy dragged their trunks down to Magpie Lane and said their goodnights. Robin felt a fleeting anxiety when Ramy disappeared through the door into his room \u2013 he had grown used to Ramy\u2019s company during all those nights on the voyage, and he was scared of being on his own for the first time in weeks, with no other voice to soften the dark.",
    "But when he closed his own door behind him, he was surprised by how normal everything felt. His desk, bed, and bookshelves were exactly as he\u2019d left them. Nothing had changed in his absence. The translation of the Shanhaijing he\u2019d been working on for Professor Chakravarti still sat on his desk, half-finished in the middle of a sentence. The scout must have been in recently, because there wasn\u2019t a speck of dust in sight.",
    "As he sat down on his lumpy mattress and breathed in the familiar, comforting scent of old books and mildew, Robin felt that if he only lay back and closed his eyes, he could get up in the morning and head to class like nothing had ever happened..",
    "\u2018Thanks.\u2019 He took the cup in both hands and sipped. It was their favourite blend of Assam, dark and heady and strong. For just a blissful moment there, sunlight streaming through the window and birds chirping softly outside, all that had transpired in Canton seemed like a terrible dream before cold, twisting memory sank in. He sighed. \u2018What\u2019s going on?\u2019",
    "Robin washed his face and dressed. Across the hall, Victoire and Letty sat perched on Ramy\u2019s sofa as Ramy passed around tea, a burlap sack of scones, and a small pot of clotted cream. \u2018I assumed no one felt like going to hall, so that\u2019s breakfast.\u2019",
    "That was how Robin felt too. It seemed wrong to be back among his creature comforts, to sit on Ramy\u2019s sofa and have their favourite tea with scones from their favourite caf\u00e9. Their situation did not feel commensurate to the stakes. The stakes, rather, seemed to demand that the world be on fire.",
    "\u2018So, listen.\u2019 Ramy took a seat beside Robin. \u2018We can\u2019t just wait around. Every passing second is one that we\u2019re not in prison, and so we\u2019ve got to use them. We\u2019ve got to find Hermes. Birdie, how do you contact Griffin?\u2019",
    "\u2018I do think they\u2019ll be looking out for us,\u2019 said Robin. \u2018After what happened that night we were caught \u2013 I mean, there are too many loose ends, and now we\u2019re all back I assume they\u2019ll want to be in touch.\u2019",
    "None of them could know for sure. Term was not due to start for another week, at which point it would be very suspicious that Professor Lovell had not returned to teach. But suppose the other professors had expected them all back earlier?",
    "\u2018Here\u2019s an idea,\u2019 said Victoire. \u2018We could go to his office and look through his correspondence, see if there are any appointments he was due to keep \u2013 or even forge some replies if that buys us a little time.\u2019",
    "\u2018Everyone calm down.\u2019 Victoire so seldom raised her voice, it hushed them at once. \u2018It\u2019s like \u2013 like an assignment, you understand? We only need a plan. We only have to break this down into component parts, finish them, and we\u2019ll be fine.\u2019 She lifted two fingers. \u2018Now, it seems there are two things we need to do. Task one: get in touch with the Hermes Society. Task two: accumulate as much information as we can so when we do reach Hermes, they\u2019ll be able to do something with it.\u2019",
    "\u2018How exposed are we?\u2019 asked Ramy. \u2018I mean, if you think about it, we\u2019re even safer here than we were on the ship. Bodies can\u2019t talk, and he\u2019s not going to wash up anywhere. Seems to me that if we all keep quiet, we\u2019re fine, aren\u2019t we?\u2019",
    "\u2018So we keep telling them the same thing,\u2019 said Victoire. \u2018He\u2019s holed up in his house, he\u2019s grievously ill, which is why he\u2019s not answering letters or taking visitors, and he told us to come back without him. That\u2019s the whole story. Keep it simple, don\u2019t embellish details. If we all give the same account, then no one will get suspicious. And if we come off as nervous, it\u2019s because we\u2019re concerned for our dear professor. Yes?\u2019",
    "She continued. \u2018What I think, though, is that the more sitting around we do \u2013 that is, the more cautiously we behave \u2013 the more suspicious we look. We can\u2019t hide away and keep out of sight. We\u2019re Babel students. We\u2019re busy. We\u2019re fourth years losing our minds from all the work we\u2019ve been assigned. We don\u2019t have to pretend we\u2019re not mad, because students here are always mad, but we\u2019ve got to pretend we\u2019re mad for the right reasons.\u2019",
    "Victoire pointed at Robin. \u2018You get the housekeeper sorted, then go and get Professor Lovell\u2019s correspondence. Ramy and I will go to Anthony\u2019s drop points and leave as many encrypted messages as we can. Letty, you\u2019ll go about your daily routine and give the impression that everything is perfectly fine. If people ask you about Canton, start spreading the story about the professor\u2019s illness. We\u2019ll all meet back here tonight, and hope to God nothing goes wrong.\u2019 She took a deep breath and looked around, nodding as if trying to convince herself.",
    "One by one they dispersed from Magpie Lane. Robin had hoped that Mrs Piper would not be at home in Jericho, that he could get away with simply leaving a message in the letterbox, but he\u2019d barely knocked before she threw the door open with a wide smile. \u2018Robin, dear!\u2019",
    "\u2018He won\u2019t be back for a bit, actually.\u2019 Robin\u2019s voice wobbled. He cleared his throat and tried again. He\u2019d never lied to Mrs Piper before, and it felt much worse than he\u2019d expected. \u2018He \u2013 well, he fell badly ill on the return voyage.\u2019",
    "\u2018Please don\u2019t,\u2019 Robin blurted. \u2018Erm \u2013 I mean, what he\u2019s got is very contagious. It spreads through the air in particles when he coughs or speaks. We couldn\u2019t even be in the same cabin with him on the ship. He\u2019s trying to see as few people as possible. But he\u2019s being taken care of. We had a doctor in to look at him\u2014\u2019",
    "\u2018Good,\u2019 said Mrs Piper. \u2018I always thought Smith was a quack. I had this terrible fever several years back, and he diagnosed it as simple hysterics. Hysterics! I couldn\u2019t even keep broth down, and he thought I was making it all up.\u2019",
    "\u2018Oh, sure, he\u2019ll be back here demanding his sultana scones by the weekend.\u2019 Mrs Piper smiled broadly. It was clearly fake; it did not quite reach her eyes, but she seemed determined to cheer him up. \u2018Well, I can look after you, at least. Can I make you some lunch?\u2019",
    "He wanted to. He wanted so badly to sit at her table, to listen to her rambling stories and feel, just for a fleeting moment, the warm comfort and safety of his childhood. But he knew he wouldn\u2019t last five minutes, much less the time it would take to pour, steep, and sip a cup of Darjeeling. If he stayed, if he stepped inside that house, he would break down completely.",
    "\u2018Oh, dear.\u2019 She wrapped her arms around him. Robin hugged her back, shoulders shaking with suppressed sobs. For the first time he realized he might never see her again \u2013 indeed, he hadn\u2019t spared a second thought about what might happen to her when it became known Professor Lovell was dead.",
    "\u2018Oh. Dear boy.\u2019 Her eyes grew leaky. \u2018Don\u2019t you worry about me. I\u2019ve got a niece and brother in Edinburgh \u2013 there\u2019s no love lost there, but they\u2019ll have to take me in if I come knocking. But it won\u2019t come to that. Richard has caught his share of foreign diseases before. He\u2019ll be back here for your monthly dinners in no time, and I\u2019ll treat you both to a whole roasted goose when he is.\u2019 She squeezed his shoulders. \u2018You just focus on your studies, won\u2019t you? Do good work, and don\u2019t worry about the rest.\u2019",
    "He was never going to see her again. No matter how things fell out, this at least seemed certain. Robin fixed his eyes on her gentle smile, trying to memorize this moment. \u2018I\u2019ll do my best, Mrs Piper. Goodbye.\u2019",
    "The faculty offices were on the seventh floor. Robin waited in the stairwell until he was sure the hallway was empty before he darted forth and slid Professor Lovell\u2019s key into the lock. The correspondence in the office was much the same as he\u2019d found in Hampstead: letters to Jardine, Matheson, G\u00fctzlaff, and others on war plans for the coming invasion. He shuffled some into a pile and stuffed them into his jacket. He didn\u2019t have the faintest clue what Hermes might do with them, but some proof, he assumed, was better than none.",
    "He\u2019d just locked the door behind him when he heard voices from Professor Playfair\u2019s office. The first belonged to a woman, demanding and loud. \u2018He\u2019s missed three consecutive payments, and I haven\u2019t been in touch with him in months\u2014\u2019",
    "\u2018He did not,\u2019 said the woman. \u2018You know he\u2019s terrible about such things, we never know where he\u2019s going. He doesn\u2019t write, doesn\u2019t even telegraph, he sends nothing for the children. You know, they\u2019re starting to forget they have a father.\u2019",
    "Heart pounding, Robin crept to the corner of the hallway, remaining just within earshot. The staircase was just a few feet behind him. If the door opened, he could flee to the sixth floor before anyone saw him.",
    "\u2018That must be, ah, very difficult,\u2019 Professor Playfair said awkwardly. \u2018Though I must say this isn\u2019t a subject on which Richard and I converse frequently. You\u2019d be better off taking it up directly with him\u2014\u2019",
    "\u2018Next week. Though there\u2019s been some trouble in Canton, I\u2019ve heard, so it may be a few days earlier. But I truly don\u2019t know, Mrs Lovell \u2013 I\u2019ll send word when we hear anything, but for now we know as little as you do.\u2019",
    "A tall, thin woman with grey-streaked hair stepped into the hallway. With her were two small children. The older one, a girl, looked about ten and had clearly been crying, though she concealed her sobs in one fist while she clenched her mother\u2019s hand in the other. The younger child, a boy, was much smaller \u2013 perhaps only five or six. He tottered out into the hallway as Mrs Lovell said her goodbyes to Professor Playfair.",
    "Robin\u2019s breath caught in his throat. He found himself leaning further out into the hallway, unable to look away. The boy looked so much like himself, like Griffin. His eyes were the same light brown, his hair similarly dark, though it curled more than either of theirs.",
    "The mood that night was decidedly glum. Other than the stack of letters Robin had found in Professor Lovell\u2019s office, the day had yielded nothing. The Hermes Society had remained silent. Robin\u2019s window was empty. Victoire and Ramy had been to each of Anthony\u2019s old drop points \u2013 a loose brick behind the Christ Church cathedral, a hidden bench in the Botanic Garden, an overturned and rarely used punt on the bank of the Cherwell \u2013 but none showed signs of recent visitation.",
    "At least nothing disastrous had happened \u2013 no breakdowns, no ominous encounters with the Oxford police. Letty had begun hyperventilating again in the Buttery during lunch, or so Robin heard, but Victoire had slapped her on the back and pretended she\u2019d merely choked on a grape. (Letty, Robin thought unkindly, was not helping the general feminist case that women were not nervous, pea-brained hysterics.)",
    "They were safe, perhaps, for now. Yet they could not help feeling like sitting ducks. The clock was running out on them; too many people were growing suspicious, and their luck would not hold forever. But where else could they go? If they ran, then the Hermes Society had no way of finding them. They were trapped by obligation.",
    "Every year just before the start of Hilary, the Royal Institute of Translation put on a garden party in the University College grounds for faculty, students, and graduate fellows. They\u2019d been to three by now. They were long, unremarkable events; like at all Oxford functions, the food was barely passable and the speeches were long. What Robin couldn\u2019t understand was why Ramy was making such a big deal of it.",
    "\u2018So everyone goes,\u2019 said Ramy. \u2018It\u2019s mandatory. They all know we\u2019re back by now \u2013 we ran into Professor Craft outside the Rad Cam this morning, and plenty of people saw Letty in the Buttery. We have to keep up appearances.\u2019",
    "\u2018Three courses? Wine? Speeches? Letty\u2019s barely keeping it together as it is, and you want to plant her by Craft and Playfair and expect her to talk about what a lovely time she had in Canton for over three hours?\u2019",
    "\u2018She can pretend she has food poisoning,\u2019 said Ramy. \u2018We can pretend she\u2019s been sick since this morning, which explains why she\u2019s all pale and clammy, and why she had a fit in the Buttery. But can you really argue that\u2019s more suspicious than all four of us failing to show up at all?\u2019",
    "Friday turned out to be an unseasonably hot day. It began with a typical January morning chill, but by midafternoon the sun had burned through the cloud cover and was shining in full force. They\u2019d all overestimated the cold when they got dressed, but once in the courtyard they could not easily remove their wool undershirts, which meant they had no choice but to sweat.",
    "That year\u2019s garden party was the most extravagant Babel had ever put on. The faculty was swimming in coin after a visit by the Russian Archduke Alexander to the university the previous May; the archduke, who had been so impressed by the wit and skill of his spontaneous interpreters at the reception, had made Babel a gift of one thousand pounds for discretionary funding. The professors had put that to lavish, if ill-considered, use. A string quartet played lustily in the middle of the quadrangle, though everyone veered away from them because the noise made conversation impossible.",
    "Half a dozen peacocks, reportedly imported from London Zoo, wandered around the green, harassing anyone dressed in bright colours. Three long, tented tables of food and drink occupied the centre of the green. The offerings included finger sandwiches, small pies, a grotesque variety of chocolates, and seven different flavours of ice cream..",
    "Babel scholars milled around holding rapidly warming glasses of wine, making tepid and petty conversation. Like all faculties at Oxford, the Translation Institute was rife with internal rivalries and jealousies over funding and appointments, a problem exacerbated by the fact that each regional specialist thought their language was more rich, more poetic, more literary, and more fertile for silver-working than others. Babel\u2019s departmental prejudices were just as arbitrary as they were confusing.",
    "The Romanticists enjoyed most of the literary prestige,* though Arabic and Chinese were highly prized mostly by virtue of how foreign and different they were, while languages closer to home like Gaelic and Welsh had almost no respect at all. This made small talk very dangerous; it was very easy to give offence if one displayed either too much or too little enthusiasm about one\u2019s research.",
    "Walking around in the midst of it all was Reverend Doctor Frederick Charles Plumptre, Master of the College, and it was understood at some point that each of them would have to shake his hand, pretend that they believed he remembered them when it was obvious he hadn\u2019t a clue what their names were, and suffer a painfully banal conversation about where they were from and what they studied before he let them go..",
    "All this for three unbearable hours, for no one could leave before the banquet was over. The seating charts were made; their absences would be noticed. They had to stay until the sun had set, until all the toasts had been given, and until all the scholars present had had enough of pretending to enjoy socializing for a lifetime.",
    "This is a disaster, Robin thought, glancing around. They would have been better off not showing up. None of them had their wits about them. He watched a graduate fellow ask Victoire a question three times before she finally registered his presence. Letty was standing in the corner, gulping down glass after glass of cold water as sweat dripped down her forehead.",
    "Ramy was faring the best, holding court with a gaggle of first years regaling him with questions about his voyage, but as Robin walked past him, he heard Ramy burst out in such an abrupt, hysterical peal of laughter that he nearly flinched back with fright..",
    "Robin felt dizzy as he looked out over the crowded lawn. This was madness, he thought, sheer madness that he should be standing here among the faculty, holding a wineglass, concealing the truth that he\u2019d killed one of their number. He wandered towards the buffet tables and filled a small plate with hors d\u2019oeuvres, just to have something to do, but the thought of putting any of the rapidly spoiling tarts in his mouth was nauseating.",
    "He jumped and turned. It was Professors De Vreese and Playfair. They stood on either side of him like prison guards. Robin blinked rapidly, trying to arrange his features into something like a neutral smile. \u2018Professors. Sirs.\u2019",
    "To his astonishment, Professor Playfair nodded in sympathy. \u2018Ah, well. You know what they say. Student from studere, meaning \u201cpainstaking, dedicated application\u201d. If you don\u2019t feel like a nail struck constantly by a hammer, you\u2019re doing it wrong.\u2019",
    "\u2018Good, isn\u2019t it?\u2019 Professor Playfair watched him as he chewed. \u2018Yes, it\u2019s silver-enhanced. A fanciful little match-pair that I came up with on vacation in Rome. Pomodoro is a rather fanciful description for a tomato, you see \u2013 it literally means \u201capple of gold\u201d. Now add the French intermediary, pomme d\u2019amour, and you get a richness that the English doesn\u2019t . . .\u2019",
    "\u2018I don\u2019t know.\u2019 Robin took a sip, doing his best to collect himself before he answered. \u2018You\u2019ve probably heard he\u2019s holed up with something he contracted in Canton. He looked in a bad state when we left him, I\u2019m not sure if he\u2019ll even be back for the term.\u2019",
    "\u2018Come now, Mr Swift.\u2019 Professor Playfair\u2019s voice became stern. \u2018I know he\u2019s not ill. I\u2019ve sent three messengers to London since you lot have been back, and they\u2019ve all reported the Hampstead house is presently empty.\u2019",
    "\u2018Really?\u2019 Robin\u2019s ears began to buzz. What was he supposed to do now? Was there any point in trying to maintain the lie? Should he just cut and run? \u2018How very odd, that\u2019s \u2013 I don\u2019t know why he would . . .\u2019",
    "Robin nearly spat out his claret. His throat caught the wine before he made a mess, but he then swallowed it up the wrong channel. Professor Playfair stood by calmly as he choked and gasped, spilling both his plate and glass in the process.",
    "Robin had no idea what to make of this. Certainly he felt no relief. Trust no one \u2013 Griffin had all but engraved this lesson in his bones. Professor Playfair could be easily lying \u2013 and this would be the simplest trick, too, if his goal was to coax Robin into spilling everything that he knew. Or Professor Playfair could be the ally, the saviour they\u2019d been waiting for. He felt a pang of residual frustration. If only Griffin had ever told him more, if only Griffin hadn\u2019t been so happy to leave him in the dark, cut off from others, and so utterly helpless.",
    "He had no useful information to act on, only a gut instinct that something was badly wrong. \u2018Thank the Lord,\u2019 he said, mirroring Professor Playfair\u2019s covert murmur. \u2018So you know about Griffin\u2019s Canton plot?\u2019",
    "Robin paused. He had to play this next part very carefully. He had to reel out just enough to keep Professor Playfair on the line, curious but not quite ready to pounce. And he needed time \u2013 at least enough time to gather the others and run.",
    "\u2018Not here.\u2019 Robin\u2019s eyes darted around the quad. Letty and Victoire were both staring at him over their shoulders. He blinked hard, glanced pointedly at the front exit, then back at them. \u2018Not in front of the faculty, you never know who\u2019s listening.\u2019",
    "\u2018The tunnels,\u2019 said Robin, before Professor Playfair could suggest that they leave the party right then. \u2018I\u2019m meeting Griffin and the others tonight at the Taylorian tunnels at midnight, why don\u2019t you come? I\u2019ve got . . . I\u2019ve got all those documents they\u2019ve been waiting for.\u2019",
    "Then it took everything he had not to break into a run. He scanned the quad for Ramy, who was trapped in a conversation with Reverend Doctor Plumptre. Robin blinked frantically at him. Immediately Ramy spilled his wineglass all over his own front, exclaimed loudly in dismay, made his excuses, and beelined through the garden towards Robin.",
    "\u2018We have to go.\u2019 To his relief, Robin saw that Victoire and Letty were already moving towards the front gate. He wanted to follow, but too many faculty stood between them; he and Ramy would have to go out the back, by the kitchens. \u2018Come on.\u2019",
    "\u2018Later.\u2019 Robin hazarded a glimpse over his shoulder just before they left the garden. His stomach twisted \u2013 Playfair was saying something to Professor De Vreese, their heads bent close together. De Vreese glanced up and looked straight into Robin\u2019s eyes. Robin looked away. \u2018Just \u2013 come on.\u2019",
    "They had, Robin realized, been walking without purpose. They were headed now for High Street, but what would they do there? If Professor Playfair called for the police, they\u2019d be spotted in seconds. They couldn\u2019t go back into Number 4; they\u2019d be trapped. But they had no money on their persons, and no means to pay the fare to anywhere else.",
    "Their shock was fleeting. Anthony broke into a run, and they followed without question. But instead of doubling back on Magpie Lane all the way to Merton Street, from where they might escape out towards Christ Church meadow, he took them back onto Kybald towards the college.",
    "They obeyed. It was wonderful to have someone tell them what to do. Anthony led them through the doors behind the kitchen, past the Old Library, and straight into the hall. On the other side of the wall, the garden party was still going on in full force; they could hear string instruments and voices through the stone.",
    "They darted in and shut the heavy wooden doors behind them. Outside service hours, the chapel felt strange: unearthly, silent. The air inside was repressively still. Apart from their panting, the only movement was the dust motes floating in the prisms of light streaming through the windows.",
    "\u2018Hush.\u2019 Anthony reached towards the epigram, which read, He formed a digest of Hindu and Mohammedan Laws. He touched a succession of letters in turn, which sank slightly back into the stone when pushed. G, O, R . . .",
    "There was a scraping noise, then a whoosh of cold air. The frieze popped several inches out from the wall. Anthony pushed his fingers into the crack at the bottom edge and slid the panel upwards to reveal a pitch-black hole in the wall. \u2018Get in.\u2019",
    "One by one, they helped each other inside. The tunnel turned out to be much wider than it appeared from the outside. They only had to crawl on their hands and knees for several seconds before the shaft emptied into a larger corridor. Robin could just feel the damp earth skimming the top of his head when he stood, though Ramy exclaimed when his head bumped against the ceiling.",
    "\u2018Ah, sorry.\u2019 Anthony struck a match, and a flame materialized in his palm. Now they could see that several yards in, the cramped shaft expanded outwards into something more like a hallway. \u2018There we go. Keep going, there\u2019s a long walk ahead.\u2019",
    "The tunnel widened more and more as they walked. The branch leading to the Univ chapel was apparently a new addition, for the passage where they walked now seemed much larger and older. Dried mud gave way to brick walls, and at several junctures, Robin saw sconces affixed to the upper corners. The dark should have felt claustrophobic, but in fact it felt comforting. Swallowed in the belly of the earth, truly hidden from view for the first time since their return voyage, they all found that they could finally breathe.",
    "\u2018Only a few decades, actually,\u2019 said Anthony. \u2018The tunnels have been here forever \u2013 they aren\u2019t a Hermes project, we only took advantage of them \u2013 but that entryway is new. Lady Jones had the frieze installed not too many years ago, but we got in fast before construction work was done. Don\u2019t worry, no one else knows. Is everyone all right?\u2019",
    "\u2018Griffin\u2019s been afraid of this for a while. We\u2019ve kept an eye on Jardine and Matheson, been tracking developments in the Factories. Though it\u2019s never got this bad before. Up until now it was all noise. But they\u2019ll really go to war, you think?\u2019",
    "\u2018Very good. I\u2019ll have that sorted. In the meantime, I suggest you all calm down.\u2019 He paused, turned around, and gave them a warm smile. After the week they\u2019d just had, the sight of Anthony\u2019s face in the soft candlelight made Robin want to cry with relief. \u2018You\u2019re in safe hands now. I agree it\u2019s quite dire, but we can\u2019t solve anything in this tunnel. You\u2019ve done very well, and I imagine you\u2019re quite scared, but you can relax now. The grown-ups are here.\u2019",
    "The underground passage turned out to be quite long. Robin lost track of how far they walked; it had to be nearly a mile. He wondered how vast the network was \u2013 now and then they passed a split in the tunnel or a door embedded in the wall, suggesting more hidden entrances across the university, but Anthony shepherded them along without comment. These were, Robin assumed, among Hermes\u2019s many secrets.",
    "\u2018Let me try to explain,\u2019 Anthony said gently. \u2018On the eve of abolition throughout the colonies, my master decided he wanted to pack up and return to America. I wouldn\u2019t be free there, you see. He could keep me in his household and call me his. This man had labelled himself an abolitionist. He\u2019d decried the general trade for years; he just seemed to think our relationship was special. But when the proposals he\u2019d publicly supported became law, he decided he really couldn\u2019t bear the sacrifice of losing me. So I went on the run and sought refuge at Oxford.",
    "The college took me in and hid me until I was legally declared a free man \u2013 not because they care much about abolition either, but because the professors at Babel knew my worth. And they knew if I were sent back to America, they would lose me to Harvard or Princeton.\u2019.",
    "At last, the tunnel ended in a set of steps covered with a wooden board, sunlight streaming in through the slats. Anthony pressed his ears to the slats, waited a moment, then unlocked the board and pushed. \u2018Come on up.\u2019",
    "They emerged in a sunny yard facing an old one-storey brick building half-hidden behind a mass of overgrown shrubbery. They couldn\u2019t have strayed too far from the town centre \u2013 they were only two miles out at most \u2013 but Robin had never seen this building before. Its doors looked rusted shut, and its walls were nearly swallowed by ivy, as if someone had built this place and then abandoned it decades ago.",
    "\u2018Welcome to the Old Library.\u2019 Anthony helped them out of the tunnel. \u2018Durham College built this place in the fourteenth century as an overflow room for old books, then forgot about it when they secured funding to build a new library closer to the centre of town.\u2019",
    "\u2018None that we use. A name would mark its importance, and we want it unnoticed and forgotten \u2013 something you skim over when you see it in the records, something easily confused for something else.\u2019 Anthony spread his palm against the rusted door, murmured something under his breath, and then pushed. The door screeched open. \u2018Come on in.\u2019",
    "Like Babel, the Old Library was much larger on the inside than its exterior suggested. From the outside, it looked as if it could contain a single lecture hall at most. Its interior, meanwhile, could have been the ground floor of the Radcliffe Library. Wooden bookshelves radiated from the centre, and more lined walls which looked, magically and contradictorily, circular. All the shelves were meticulously labelled, and a long yellowed parchment listing the classification system hung from the opposite wall.",
    "Near the front was a shelf boasting new arrivals, on which Robin recognized a few of the titles he\u2019d snuck out for Griffin over the past few years. They\u2019d all had their Babel serial numbers scratched out..",
    "\u2018We don\u2019t like their categorization system,\u2019 explained Anthony. \u2018It only makes sense in Roman characters, but not every language is so easily Romanized, is it?\u2019 He pointed to a mat near the door. \u2018Wipe your shoes off, we don\u2019t like tracking mud between the shelves. And there\u2019s a stand over there for your coats.\u2019",
    "\u2018Not tea, clearly.\u2019 Anthony swung the kettle towards them to reveal the bottom, which displayed a familiar glint of silver. \u2018It\u2019s a security system. It whistles when someone we don\u2019t know gets near the library.\u2019",
    "\u2018Wouldn\u2019t you like to know?\u2019 Anthony winked. \u2018We do security like Babel does. Everyone devises their own traps, and we don\u2019t tell the others how it\u2019s done. The best thing we have set up is the glamour \u2013 it keeps sound from escaping the building, which means no passerby can eavesdrop on our conversations.\u2019",
    "\u2018Oldest trick in the world. We\u2019re hidden in plain sight.\u2019 Anthony led them further into the library. \u2018When Durham went extinct in the mid-sixteenth century and Trinity took over its property, they overlooked the supplemental library in the deed transfer. The only things listed in that library on the catalogue were materials no one had used for decades, and which have more accessible duplicates in the Bodleian. So now we live on the edge of bureaucracy \u2013 everyone who walks past knows this is a storage library, but everyone assumes it belongs to some other, poorer college.",
    "Figures emerged from within the shelves. Robin recognized them all \u2013 they were all former students or current graduate fellows he\u2019d seen lurking around the tower. He supposed this shouldn\u2019t have come as a surprise. There were Vimal Srinivasan, Cathy O\u2019Nell, and Ilse Dejima, who gave them a small wave as she approached.",
    "Anthony chuckled. \u2018I\u2019m the only ghost in residence at Oxford. We have a few others overseas \u2013 Vaibhav and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique, you might have heard of them \u2013 they faked drowning on a clipper back from Bombay and they\u2019ve been operating from India since. Lisette simply announced she was leaving for home to get married, and all the Babel faculty were too disappointed in her to follow up on her story. Obviously, Vimal, Cathy, and Ilse are still at Babel. Easier for them to siphon out resources.\u2019",
    "\u2018Someone needs to be in the Old Library full time. In any case, I\u2019d got tired of the campus life, so I faked my death in Barbados, bought a passage on the next packet home, and made my way back to Oxford unnoticed.\u2019 Anthony winked at Robin. \u2018I thought you had me that day at the bookshop. I didn\u2019t dare leave the Old Library for a week. Come on, let me show you the rest.\u2019",
    "A quick tour of the workspaces past the shelves revealed a number of ongoing projects, which Anthony introduced with pride. These included the compilation of dictionaries between regional languages (\u2018We lose a lot by assuming everything must first come through English\u2019), non-English silver match-pairs (\u2018Same principle \u2013 Babel won\u2019t fund match-pairs that don\u2019t translate into English since all of its bars are for use by the British.",
    "But that\u2019s like painting with only one colour, or playing only one note on a piano.\u2019), and critiques of existing English translations of religious texts and literary classics (\u2018Well \u2013 you know my opinion on literature in general, but something has to keep Vimal occupied.\u2019) The Hermes Society was not only a hotbed of Robin Hoods, as Griffin had led Robin to believe; it was also a research centre in its own right, though its projects had to be done in secret, with scant and stolen resources.*.",
    "\u2018Of course,\u2019 said Anthony. \u2018It\u2019s only recently that Babel achieved pre-eminence in linguistics and philology. It was the French who ran the show for most of the eighteenth century, and then the German Romanticists had their heyday for a bit. The difference now is that we have silver to spare, and they don\u2019t.\u2019*",
    "\u2018They\u2019re fickle allies, though,\u2019 said Vimal. \u2018They\u2019re helpful insofar as they, too, hate the British, but they\u2019ve no real commitment towards global liberation. Really, all this research is just gambling on the future. We can\u2019t make good use of it yet. We haven\u2019t got the reach or the resources. So it\u2019s all we can do to produce the knowledge, write it down, and hope one day there exists a state that can put all this to proper, altruistic use.\u2019",
    "At the other end of the library, the back wall resembled the aftermath of several mortar explosions, charred and cratered across the centre. Underneath, two equally charred tables stood side by side, both somehow upright despite their blackened, shrivelled legs.",
    "The intact portion of the back wall was covered with a massive map of the world, dotted with differently coloured pins attached by strings to notes covered in dense, tiny handwriting. Robin wandered closer, curious.",
    "\u2018We think they do. We\u2019re trying to track the number of languages still spoken around the world, and where they\u2019re dying out. And there are a good deal of languages which are dying, you know. A great extinction event began the day Christopher Columbus set foot in the New World. Spanish, Portuguese, French, English \u2013 they\u2019ve been edging out regional languages and dialects like cuckoo chicks. I think it\u2019s not inconceivable that one day, most of the world will speak only English.\u2019 She sighed, looking up at the map. \u2018I was born a generation too late.",
    "The offerings at dinner were global \u2013 a vegetable curry, a platter of boiled potatoes, a fried fish dish that tasted startlingly similar to a kind Robin had once eaten in Canton, and a flat, chewy bread that paired well with everything else. The eight of them sat around a very fine ornamented table that looked incongruous against the plain wooden panels. There weren\u2019t enough chairs for all of them, so Anthony and Ilse had dragged over benches and sitting stools from around the library. None of the tableware matched, nor the silverware.",
    "Flames burned merrily from a fireplace in the corner, heating the room unevenly so that Robin\u2019s left side dripped sweat while his right side felt chilly. The whole scene was quintessentially collegial..",
    "\u2018Proper adults? Reinforcements?\u2019 Anthony nodded. \u2018Some, yes. They\u2019re scattered across the globe. I don\u2019t know who they all are \u2013 not one of us knows exhaustively who they all are, and that\u2019s intentional. There are probably even Hermes associates at Babel I\u2019m still not aware of, though whoever they are, I hope they start making a bit more of an effort.\u2019",
    "Robin thought of the two thieves he\u2019d met his first night at Oxford, the young woman and the blond-haired man, neither of whom he\u2019d ever seen again. He did not venture to ask. He knew the answer: attrition.",
    "\u2018Well, it\u2019s not so different from Oxford bureaucracy,\u2019 Anthony said. \u2018The university, the colleges, and the faculties never seem to agree on who\u2019s in charge of what, but they get things done, don\u2019t they?\u2019",
    "\u2018Ah, pommes de terre \u00e0 l\u2019anglaise.\u2019 Anthony speared a potato with his fork. \u2018You know why the French called boiled potatoes \u00e0 l\u2019anglaise? Because they think boiling things is boring, Cathy, just like all of English cooking is deathly boring\u2014\u2019",
    "Watching them, Robin felt a sharp prickle at the base of his nose. He felt the same as he had the night of the commemoration ball, dancing on the tables under the fairy lights. How magical, he thought; how impossible, that a place like this could exist, a distillation of all that Babel promised. He felt he\u2019d been looking for a place like this all his life, and still he\u2019d betrayed it.",
    "Robin\u2019s heart hammered as he filed out of the dining room with the others. He suddenly felt very nervous. He didn\u2019t want to see his brother. The world had turned upside down since they\u2019d last spoken, and he was terrified of what Griffin had to say about it.",
    "Griffin strode through the door looking lean, haggard, and as travel-weary as ever. Robin scrutinized his brother as he shrugged off his ratty black coat. He seemed like an utter stranger, now that Robin knew what he had done. Each of his features told a new story; those lean, capable hands; those sharp, darting eyes \u2013 were those the traits of a murderer? How had he felt when he threw a silver bar at Evie Brooke, knowing full well it would rip her chest apart? Had he laughed when she died, the way he did upon seeing Robin now?",
    "\u2018The opium-burning disaster has brought everything to a head,\u2019 said Griffin. \u2018Commissioner Lin has issued a proclamation banning English trade from Canton entirely. Jardine & Matheson, meanwhile, have taken those hostilities as justification for war. They\u2019re saying England must act now to defend her honour, or face humiliation in the East forever. Nice way to ruffle some nationalist feathers. The House of Lords began debating a military expedition last week.\u2019",
    "But a vote had not yet come to pass. The lords of Parliament were still hesitant, uncertain about throwing the country\u2019s resources at such a distant and unprecedented endeavour. The issue at hand, however, was silver. Defeating China would give the British Empire access to the greatest reserve of silver in the world, silver that would make their warships sail faster, their guns shoot further and more precisely. If Parliament did choose war, the future of the colonized world was unimaginable.",
    "\u2018But we can\u2019t do anything about those plots right now,\u2019 said Griffin. \u2018And we can\u2019t think on the scale of a global revolution, because it\u2019s impossible. We don\u2019t have the numbers. What we must focus on now, before we can turn to anything else, is stopping the invasion of Canton. If England wins \u2013 for she absolutely will win, there\u2019s no question \u2013 she obtains a near infinite supply of silver for the foreseeable future. If she doesn\u2019t, her silver supply dries up, and her imperial capacities shrink considerably. That\u2019s it. Everything else is inconsequential.\u2019",
    "He rapped the blackboard, on which names of various lords were sorted into different columns. \u2018The House of Commons hasn\u2019t voted yet. It\u2019s still an open debate. There\u2019s a strong antiwar faction, headed by Sir James Graham, Viscount Mahon, and William Gladstone. And Gladstone\u2019s a very good man to have on our side \u2013 he hates opium more than anyone; he\u2019s got a sister who\u2019s addicted to laudanum, I think.\u2019",
    "\u2018But there are internal politics at play too,\u2019 Cathy explained. \u2018The Melbourne ministry\u2019s facing a political crisis at home. The Whigs have just barely survived a vote of no confidence, so now they\u2019re walking an impossible tightrope between the Conservatives and Radicals, exacerbated by the fact that they\u2019ve been weak in foreign trade in Mexico, Argentina, and Arabia\u2014\u2019",
    "Cathy waved her hand impatiently. \u2018The bottom line is, the Radicals and their northern constituencies need a healthy overseas trade, and the Whigs need to keep their support to counterbalance the Tories. A show of force regarding the Opium Crisis is precisely the way to do that. It\u2019ll be a tight vote either way, though.\u2019",
    "\u2018Indeed,\u2019 said Anthony. \u2018We\u2019ll have to convince them that war is against the best interests of their constituents. Now, that\u2019s a tricky argument to make, because it affects different classes differently. Obviously, siphoning all the silver out of China will be a massive boon to anyone who\u2019s already got money. But there\u2019s also an existing movement that believes that increased silver use is the worst thing that could happen to labourers. A silver-enhanced loom puts a dozen weavers out of work; that\u2019s why they\u2019re always striking. That\u2019s a decent argument for a Radical to vote no.\u2019",
    "\u2018Good question,\u2019 said Anthony. \u2018The lords are the decision-makers, yes, but a certain amount of pressure from the press and public can sway those still on the fence. The trick is how to get the average Londoner worked up over a war they\u2019re not likely to have ever heard of.\u2019",
    "\u2018It simply seems to me that all this aggression is quite pre-emptive,\u2019 Letty insisted. \u2018I mean, you haven\u2019t even tried making your case to the public. Have you ever considered you might better make your point by being nice?\u2019",
    "\u2018But public opinion on China is malleable,\u2019 Anthony intervened. \u2018Most Londoners oppose the opium trade to begin with, and there\u2019s quite a lot of sympathetic coverage for Commissioner Lin in the newspapers. You can get pretty far with moralists and religious conservatives in this country. The question there is how to get them sufficiently bothered about it to exert pressure on Parliament. Unpopular wars have been fought over less.\u2019",
    "\u2018That\u2019s a work in progress; we\u2019re still fiddling around with it. If we can just connect that semantic warp with the right medium, we might get somewhere. But the point is, we can\u2019t achieve anything until more people understand where we\u2019re coming from. Most of the British don\u2019t understand there\u2019s a fight to be had at all. For them, this war is something imaginary \u2013 something that could only benefit them, something they don\u2019t have to look at or worry over. They don\u2019t know the cruelty involved, or the continued violence it will enable. They don\u2019t know what opium does to people.\u2019",
    "\u2018Because I didn\u2019t,\u2019 said Robin. \u2018I didn\u2019t, even though I\u2019d been told time and time again how awful things were. It took witnessing it happening, in person, for me to realize all the abstractions were real. And even then, I tried my very hardest to look away. It\u2019s hard to accept what you don\u2019t want to see.\u2019",
    "So that was the goal of the night: to shift the engines of history onto a different track. Things were not as helpless as they seemed. The Hermes Society had several plans already in motion, most including various forms of bribery and blackmail, and one including the destruction of a shipyard in Glasgow.",
    "\u2018The vote for war hinges on Parliament\u2019s belief that it\u2019ll be easily won,\u2019 Griffin explained. \u2018And technically, yes, our ships could blow Canton\u2019s navy out of the water. But they run on silver to work. A few months ago, Thomas Peacock\u2014\u2019",
    "\u2018Indeed. He\u2019s a rabid enthusiast of steam technology, and he put in an order for six iron steamboats at the shipbuilders Laird\u2019s. William Laird and Son, that is \u2013 they\u2019re based in Glasgow. These ships are more frightening than anything the waters of Asia have ever seen. They\u2019ve got Congreve rockets, and their shallow draught and steam power make them more mobile than anything in the Chinese fleet. If Parliament votes yes, at least one of them is heading straight to Canton.\u2019",
    "\u2018Because we\u2019re scholars, not soldiers,\u2019 said Anthony. \u2018The shipyard\u2019s one thing, but we\u2019re not going to take on the entire British Navy. We\u2019ve got to leverage influence where we can. Leave the violent theatrics to Griffin\u2014\u2019",
    "So they went back to the blackboard. A war for the fate of the world could not be won overnight \u2013 this they all knew in theory \u2013 but they could not bring themselves to stop and go to sleep. Every passing hour brought new ideas and tactics, though as the hours dragged far past midnight, their thoughts began to lose some coherence. Suppose they ensnared Lord Palmerston in a prostitution scandal by sending in Letty and Cathy to seduce him in disguise. Suppose they convinced the British public that the country China did not actually exist and was in fact an elaborate hoax by Marco Polo.",
    "At some point, they dissolved into helpless laughter as Griffin described in intricate detail a plot to kidnap Queen Victoria in the gardens of Buckingham Palace under the guise of an underground Chinese crime ring and hold her hostage in Trafalgar Square..",
    "This creative problem-solving, this breaking up of a momentous mission into a dozen small tasks which, combined with enormous luck and possibly divine intervention, might carry them to victory \u2013 it all reminded him of how it felt to be in the library working on a thorny translation at four in the morning, laughing hysterically because they were so unbelievably tired but somehow thrumming with energy because it was such a thrill when a solution inevitably coalesced from their mess of scrawled notes and wild brainstorming..",
    "For some reason they kept coming back to the polemik\u00f3s match-pair, perhaps because it did in fact seem like they were fighting a war of ideas, a battle for Britain\u2019s soul. Discursive metaphors, Letty observed, revolved around war imagery rather often. \u2018Think about it,\u2019 she said. \u2018Their stance is indefensible. We must attack their weak points. We must shoot down their premises.\u2019",
    "\u2018When God saw this, He did not permit them, but smote them with blindness and confusion of speech, and rendered them as thou seest,\u2019* Griffin said grandly. \u2018Look, it\u2019s a good idea. If we could just take out the tower\u2014\u2019",
    "\u2018We don\u2019t need an army,\u2019 said Griffin. \u2018They\u2019re scholars, not soldiers. You take a gun in there, wave it around and shout for a bit, and you\u2019ve taken the whole tower hostage. And then you\u2019ve taken the whole country hostage. Babel is the crux, Anthony; it\u2019s the source of all the Empire\u2019s power. We\u2019ve only got to seize it.\u2019",
    "Robin stared at him, alarmed. In Chinese, the phrase hu\u01d2y\u00e0ow\u00e8i* meant literally \u2018the taste of gunpowder\u2019; figuratively, \u2018belligerence, combativeness\u2019. His brother smelled of gunpowder. He reeked of violence.",
    "\u2018I want to occupy the tower. It wouldn\u2019t be so very difficult.\u2019 Griffin shrugged. \u2018And it\u2019s a more direct solution to our problems, isn\u2019t it? I\u2019ve been trying to convince these fellows, but they\u2019re too scared to pull it off.\u2019",
    "\u2018But think of what would happen,\u2019 Griffin insisted. \u2018What does this country do without enchanted silver? Without the people to maintain it? Steam power, gone. Perpetual lamps, gone. Building reinforcements, gone. The roads would deteriorate, the carriages would malfunction \u2013 forget Oxford, the whole of England would fall apart in months. They\u2019d be brought to their knees. Paralysed.\u2019",
    "They adjourned at three in the morning. Anthony showed them to a sink at the back of the library where they could wash \u2013 \u2018No tub, sorry, so you\u2019ll have to soap your armpits standing up \u2013\u2019 and then pulled a stack of quilts and pillows from a cupboard.",
    "\u2018We only have three cots,\u2019 he said apologetically. \u2018We don\u2019t often all spend the night here. Ladies, why don\u2019t you follow Ilse to the Reading Room \u2013 and gents, you can bunk on your own between the stacks. Creates a bit of privacy.\u2019",
    "Robin was so exhausted then that a space of hardwood between the shelves sounded wonderful. It felt as if he had been awake for one long day ever since their arrival in Oxford; that he had experienced enough for one lifetime. He accepted a quilt from Anthony and made his way towards the stacks, but Griffin materialized by his side before he could settle down. \u2018Have a moment?\u2019",
    "Robin sighed, set the quilt down, and followed Griffin out the door. The yard was very bright under the full moon. Griffin must have used it for shooting practice often, for Robin could see that the trees across the yard were riddled with bullet holes.",
    "\u2018Well, it\u2019s never too late to learn.\u2019 Griffin placed the gun in Robin\u2019s hands. Like silver bars, it was heavier than it looked, and very cool to the touch. There was a certain inarguable elegance to the curve of the wooden handle, how easily it fitted into his hand. Still, Robin felt a wave of revulsion as he held it. It felt mean, like the metal was trying to bite him. He wanted very much to fling it to the ground, but was afraid of accidentally setting it off.",
    "\u2018This is a pepperbox revolver,\u2019 said Griffin. \u2018Very popular with civilians. It uses a caplock mechanism, which means it can fire when it\u2019s wet \u2013 don\u2019t look down the barrel, you idiot, never look straight down the barrel. Try aiming it.\u2019",
    "\u2018It doesn\u2019t matter that you\u2019ll fire it. It matters that someone thinks you will. You see, my colleagues in there are still holding on to this unbelievable faith in human goodness.\u2019 Griffin cocked the gun and pointed it at a birch tree across the yard. \u2018But I\u2019m a sceptic. I think decolonization must be a violent process.\u2019",
    "\u2018Scary, isn\u2019t it? Think, why is this more frightening than a knife?\u2019 Griffin did not move his arm. \u2018It says I\u2019m willing to kill you, and all I have to do is pull this trigger. I can kill at a distance, without effort. A gun takes all the hard work out of murder and makes it elegant. It shrinks the distance between resolve and action, you see?\u2019",
    "\u2018Evie wasn\u2019t some innocent bystander,\u2019 Griffin sneered. \u2018We\u2019d been trying to recruit her for months. It was tricky, see, because she and Sterling Jones were so close, but if either of them had a conscience it was bound to be her. Or so we thought. I spent months and months talking things over with her at the Twisted Root until one night she decided she was ready, she was in. Only it was all a set-up \u2013 she\u2019d been talking to the constables and the professors the whole time, and they\u2019d hatched this plan to catch me in the act.",
    "\u2018She was a brilliant actor, you see. She had this way of looking at you, eyes wide, nodding like you had all of her sympathy. Of course, I didn\u2019t know it was all a performance. I thought I\u2019d made an ally \u2013 I was thrilled when she seemed to be coming around \u2013 and with everyone we lost in Burma, I felt very alone. And Evie was so clever about it. Asked all these questions, far more than you did \u2013 made it sound like she just wanted to know because she was so thrilled to join the cause, because she wanted to learn all the ways she could help.\u2019",
    "\u2018She smiled at me,\u2019 said Griffin. \u2018When the siren sounded, she grinned at me and told me it was all over. And so I killed her. I didn\u2019t mean to. You won\u2019t believe me, but it\u2019s the truth. I meant to frighten her. But I was angry and scared \u2013 and Evie was vicious, you know. If I\u2019d given her an opening, I still think she might have hurt me first.\u2019",
    "\u2018I\u2019d take it all back if I could,\u2019 Robin insisted. He didn\u2019t know why it felt so important that Griffin believe him, but this seemed like the last line he had to hold, the last truth he had to maintain about his identity. Otherwise he didn\u2019t recognize himself. \u2018I wish he\u2019d lived\u2014\u2019",
    "\u2018Our father,\u2019 Griffin said loudly, \u2018was a cruel, selfish man who thought anyone who wasn\u2019t white and English was less than human. Our father destroyed my mother\u2019s life, and let yours perish. Our father is one of the principal engineers of a war on our motherland. If he\u2019d come back from Canton alive, Parliament wouldn\u2019t be debating right now. They\u2019d have voted already. You\u2019ve bought us days, perhaps weeks. So what if you\u2019re a killer, brother? The world\u2019s better off without the professor in it.",
    "\u2018But if this is a war, then you\u2019ve lost.\u2019 Still Robin refused to take the gun. \u2018There\u2019s no way you win on the battlefield. Your ranks are what, a couple dozen? At most? And you\u2019re going to take on the entire British Army?\u2019",
    "\u2018Oh, but that\u2019s where you\u2019re wrong,\u2019 said Griffin. \u2018The thing about violence, see, is that the Empire has a lot more to lose than we do. Violence disrupts the extractive economy. You wreak havoc on one supply line, and there\u2019s a dip in prices across the Atlantic. Their entire system of trade is high-strung and vulnerable to shocks because they\u2019ve made it thus, because the rapacious greed of capitalism is punishing. It\u2019s why slave revolts succeed. They can\u2019t fire on their own source of labour \u2013 it\u2019d be like killing their own golden geese.",
    "\u2018But if the system is so fragile, why do we so easily accept the colonial situation? Why do we think it\u2019s inevitable? Why doesn\u2019t Man Friday ever get himself a rifle, or slit Robinson Crusoe\u2019s neck in the night? The problem is that we\u2019re always living like we\u2019ve lost. We\u2019re all living like you. We see their guns, their silver-work, and their ships, and we think it\u2019s already over for us. We don\u2019t stop to consider how even the playing field actually might be. And we never consider what things would look like if we took the gun.\u2019 Once again, Griffin offered the gun to Robin.",
    "\u2018Violence shows them how much we\u2019re willing to give up,\u2019 said Griffin. \u2018Violence is the only language they understand, because their system of extraction is inherently violent. Violence shocks the system. And the system cannot survive the shock. You have no idea what you\u2019re capable of, truly. You can\u2019t imagine how the world might shift unless you pull the trigger.\u2019 Griffin pointed at the middle birch. \u2018Pull the trigger, kid.\u2019",
    "Robin obeyed. The bang split his ears; he nearly dropped the gun. He was sure he had not aimed true. He had not been prepared for the force of the kickback, and his arm trembled from wrist to shoulder. The birch was untouched. The bullet had flown pointlessly into the dark.",
    "But he had to admit that Griffin was right \u2013 the rush of that moment, the explosion of force contained within its hands, the sheer power he could trigger with just a twitch of his finger \u2013 it felt good.",
    "Robin couldn\u2019t fall asleep after Griffin left for Glasgow. He sat in the dark, thrumming with nervous energy. He felt a breathless vertigo, the sensation of looking out over a steep cliff the moment before he jumped. The whole world was on the verge of some cataclysmic shift, it seemed, and he could only cling on to what was around him as they all hurtled towards the breaking point.",
    "An hour later the Old Library began to stir. Just as the clock struck seven, a symphony of birdsong echoed through the stacks. The noise was too loud to be coming from outside; rather, it sounded as if a whole flock of birds was perched invisibly among the books.",
    "\u2018It\u2019s coming from here.\u2019 Anthony showed them a wooden grandfather clock decorated with carved songbirds around the edges. \u2018A gift from one of our Swedish associates. She translated g\u00f6katta to \u201crising at dawn\u201d, only in Swedish, g\u00f6katta has the particular meaning of waking up early to listen to the birds sing. There\u2019s some music box mechanism inside, but the silver really imitates true birdsong. It\u2019s lovely, isn\u2019t it?\u2019",
    "Cathy brought out a steaming pot of black tea, and they held their mugs forth in gratitude. Vimal stumbled yawning from the bathroom towards the kitchen. A few minutes later, the wonderful aroma of a fry-up seeped up through the Reading Room. \u2018Masala eggs,\u2019 he announced, heaping scrambled eggs in a tomatoey mess onto their plates. \u2018There\u2019s toast coming.\u2019",
    "They wolfed down their food in fast, mechanical silence. Minutes later the table was cleared, the dirty plates returned to the kitchenette. The front door screeched open. It was Ilse, back from the city centre with that morning\u2019s newspapers.",
    "\u2018They\u2019re still at loggerheads,\u2019 she said. \u2018So we have some time yet. The Whigs are shaky on their numbers, and they won\u2019t hold a vote until they\u2019re confident. But we still want those pamphlets in London today or tomorrow. Get someone on the noon train, then get them printed on Fleet Street.\u2019",
    "\u2018Yes, Theresa\u2019s still at the Standard. They go to print on Fridays. I can get in and use the machines, I\u2019m sure, if you have something for me by tonight.\u2019 She pulled a crumpled newspaper out of her messenger bag and slid it across the table. \u2018Here\u2019s the latest from London, by the way. Thought you\u2019d like to see it.\u2019",
    "\u2018Interesting. Well, London\u2019s still cancelled for you lot,\u2019 said Anthony. They all began protesting at once, but he held up a hand. \u2018Don\u2019t be mad. It\u2019s too dangerous, we\u2019re not risking it. You\u2019re hiding out in the Old Library until this is over. You can\u2019t be recognized.\u2019",
    "\u2018You can help by not getting yourself thrown in gaol. This isn\u2019t open war, as much as dear Griffin would like to pretend it is. These matters demand finesse.\u2019 Anthony pointed to the blackboard. \u2018Focus on the agenda. Let\u2019s pick up where we left off. I think we tabled the issue of Lord Arsenault last night. Letty?\u2019",
    "Letty took a long draught of her tea, closed her eyes, then seemed to pull herself together. \u2018Yes. I believe Lord Arsenault and my father are on rather good terms. I could write to him, try to set up a meeting\u2014\u2019",
    "One by one they filtered out of the Reading Room to carry out their designated tasks. Ilse set off to Babel to retrieve further news on developments in London. Cathy and Vimal went to the workshop to tinker with match-pairs using polemik\u00f3s. Ramy and Victoire were put to work writing letters to prominent Radical leaders by impersonating white, middle-aged Radical supporters. Robin sat with Anthony in the Reading Room, pulling the most damning evidence of collusion from Professor Lovell\u2019s letters as quotations for short, inflammatory pamphlets.",
    "\u2018Be careful with your language,\u2019 Anthony told him. \u2018You\u2019ll want to avoid rhetoric about anticolonialism and respecting national sovereignty. Use terms like scandal, collusion, corruption, lack of transparency, and whatnot. Cast things in terms that the average Londoner will get worked up about, and don\u2019t make it an issue of race.\u2019",
    "They worked in comfortable silence for about an hour, until Robin\u2019s hand grew too sore to continue. He sat back, cradling a mug of tea in silence, until it seemed as if Anthony had reached the end of a paragraph. \u2018Anthony, can I ask you something?\u2019",
    "\u2018I know, I know. I only mean to say that I\u2019m not as soft as Griffin thinks. Let me remind you that I came to this country before they\u2019d decided I could no longer be legally called a slave. I\u2019ve lived most of my life in a country that is deeply confused on whether I fully count as human. Trust me, I am no jolly optimist on the ethical qualms of white Britain.\u2019",
    "Anthony laughed gently. \u2018Do you think abolition was a matter of ethics? No, abolition gained popularity because the British, after losing America, decided that India was going to be their new golden goose. But cotton, indigo, and sugar from India weren\u2019t going to dominate the market unless France could be edged out, and France would not be edged out, you see, as long as the British slave trade was making the West Indies so very profitable for them.\u2019",
    "\u2018But nothing. The abolitionist movement you know is a load of pomp. Rhetoric only. Pitt first raised the motion because he saw the need to cut off the slave trade to France. And Parliament got on board with the abolitionists because they were so very afraid of Black insurrection in the West Indies.\u2019",
    "\u2018Well, not necessarily. You brother likes to argue that the Jamaican slave revolt, failed though it was, is what impelled the British to legislate abolition. He\u2019s right, but only half right. See, the revolt won British sympathy because the leaders were part of the Baptist church, and when it failed, proslavery whites in Jamaica started destroying chapels and threatening missionaries. Those Baptists went back to England and drummed up support on the grounds of religion, not natural rights.",
    "My point being, abolition happened because white people found reasons to care \u2013 whether those be economic or religious. You just have to make them think they came up with the idea themselves. You can\u2019t appeal to their inner goodness. I have never met an Englishman I trusted to do the right thing out of sympathy.\u2019.",
    "\u2018The point is to build a coalition,\u2019 said Anthony. \u2018And it needs to include unlikely sympathizers. We can siphon as many resources from Babel as we want, but it still won\u2019t be enough to budge such firmly entrenched levers of power as the likes of Jardine and Matheson. If we are to turn the tides of history, we need some of these men \u2013 the same men who find no issue in selling me and my kind at auction \u2013 to become our allies. We need to convince them that a global British expansion, founded on pyramids of silver, is not in their own best interest.",
    "\u2018Ha. No, the seeds for a coalition are there. The time\u2019s ripe for a revolution in England, you know. The whole of Europe has been feverish for reform for decades; they caught it from the French. We must simply make this a war of class instead of race. And this is, indeed, an issue of class. It seems like a debate over opium and China, but the Chinese aren\u2019t the only ones who stand to lose, are they? It\u2019s all related. The silver industrial revolution is one of the greatest drivers of inequality, pollution, and unemployment in this country.",
    "The fate of a poor family in Canton is in fact intricately tied to the fate of an out-of-work weaver from Yorkshire. Neither benefits from the expansion of empire. Both only get poorer as the companies get richer. So if they could only form an alliance . . .\u2019 Anthony wove his fingers together. \u2018But that\u2019s the problem, you see. No one\u2019s focused on how we\u2019re all connected. We only think about how we suffer, individually. The poor and middle-class of this country don\u2019t realize they have more in common with us than they do with Westminster.\u2019.",
    "Robin wondered then how much of Anthony\u2019s life had been spent carefully translating himself to white people, how much of his genial, affable polish was an artful construction to fit a particular idea of a Black man in white England and to afford himself maximum access within an institution like Babel.",
    "And he wondered if there would ever be a day that came when all this was unnecessary, when white people would look at him and Anthony and simply listen, when their words would have worth and value because they were uttered, when they would not have to hide who they were, when they wouldn\u2019t have to go through endless distortions just to be understood..",
    "At noon they regrouped in the Reading Room for lunch. Cathy and Vimal were quite excited with what they\u2019d done with the polemik\u00f3s match-pair, which, true to Griffin\u2019s predictions, caused pamphlets to fly about and continue flapping around bystanders if thrown into the air. Vimal had supplemented this with the Latin origin of the word discuss: discutere could mean \u2018to scatter\u2019, or \u2018to disperse\u2019.",
    "Gradually, the ideas that had seemed so ridiculous last night, those chaotic scribblings of sleep-deprived minds, coalesced into a rather impressive plan of action. Anthony summed up their numerous endeavours on the blackboard. Over the next few days, weeks if necessary, the Hermes Society would try to influence the debates in any way they could. Ilse\u2019s connection on Fleet Street would soon publish a hit piece on how William Jardine, who\u2019d stirred up all this mess in the first place, was whiling away his days at a spa town in Cheltenham.",
    "Vimal and Cathy, through several more respectable white intermediaries, would try to convince waffling Whigs that restoring good relations with China would at least keep open avenues trading legal goods, such as teas and rhubarbs. Then there were Griffin\u2019s efforts in Glasgow, as well as the pamphlets about to fly all over London. Through blackmail, lobbying, and public pressure, Anthony concluded, they might make up enough votes to defeat the war motion..",
    "The graduate fellows all exchanged glances with each other. It looked like they were having a silent conversation \u2013 a repeat, Robin guessed, of a conversation they\u2019d had many times before, for it was clear what everyone\u2019s position was. Anthony raised his eyebrows. Cathy and Vimal both nodded. Ilse, lips pursed, seemed reluctant, but at last she sighed and shrugged.",
    "Anthony stood up, disappeared for a moment into the stacks, and returned bearing a sealed envelope. \u2018This,\u2019 he said, placing it down on the table, \u2018contains the contact information for a dozen Hermes associates across the globe.\u2019",
    "\u2018No,\u2019 said Anthony. \u2018We really shouldn\u2019t. I see Griffin\u2019s paranoia has rubbed off on you, and that\u2019s not a bad thing. But suppose you lot are the only ones left. There are no names or addresses here \u2013 only drop points and contact instructions. If you end up on your own, you\u2019ll have at least some means to keep Hermes alive.\u2019",
    "Suddenly Robin felt so young, so childish. It had seemed like such a fun game, plotting into the deep hours with the Hermes Society, playing around with his older brother\u2019s gun. Their situation was so bizarre, and the conditions of victory so unimaginable, it had felt more like an exercise than real life.",
    "It sank in now that the forces they were playing with were actually quite terrifying, that the trading companies and political lobbies they were attempting to manipulate were not the laughable bogeymen they\u2019d made them out to be but incredibly powerful organizations with deep, entrenched interests in the colonial trade, interests they would murder to protect..",
    "\u2018Yes \u2013 yes, of course.\u2019 Letty seemed quite distressed; her breath came in such quick, shallow bursts that Robin was worried she might faint. Ramy pushed his chair back to give her space to break free. Letty paused by the doorway and glanced over her shoulder \u2013 her eyes lingered on Robin, and she seemed on the verge of saying something \u2013 but then she pursed her lips and hurried out the door.",
    "In the last minutes before the postgraduates left, Anthony went over housekeeping matters with Robin, Ramy, and Victoire. The kitchenette stocked enough provisions to last a week, and longer if they were happy with gruel and salt-cured fish. Fresh drinking water was trickier to acquire \u2013 the Old Library did receive its water supply from the city pumps, but they couldn\u2019t run the taps too late at night or for too long at any time, since drainage elsewhere might draw attention.",
    "\u2018And try to stay inside as much as you can,\u2019 Anthony said as he finished packing his bag. \u2018You can take turns in the yard if you like, but keep your voices down \u2013 the glamour acts up every now and then. If you must get some fresh air, do it after sunset. If you get scared, there\u2019s a rifle in that broom cupboard \u2013 I do hope you\u2019ll never have to do it, but if you do, can any of you\u2014\u2019",
    "\u2018It\u2019s close enough.\u2019 Anthony laced up his boots. \u2018Fiddle with it in your spare time; the weighting\u2019s a bit different. As for comfort, you\u2019ll find soaps and things in the bathroom cabinet. Make sure you rake the ashes out of the fireplace every morning, or it\u2019ll get stuffy. Oh \u2013 we used to have a laundry tub, but Griffin destroyed it messing around with pipe bombs. You can go a few days without changing, can\u2019t you?\u2019",
    "The postgraduates seemed to have drilled for this. Cathy and Vimal ran in from the workshop, each holding silver bars in hand. Ilse threw her weight at a towering shelf; it toppled forward, starting a chain reaction that collapsed the path in front of the police. Ramy started forward to help, but Anthony shouted, \u2018No, hide \u2013 the Reading Room\u2014\u2019",
    "They stumbled back. Anthony kicked the door shut behind them. Outside they heard booms and crashes \u2013 Anthony shouted something that sounded like \u2018The beacon\u2019, and Cathy screamed something in response \u2013 the postgraduates were fighting, fighting to defend them.",
    "But what was the point? The Reading Room was a dead end. There were no other doors, no windows. They could only huddle behind the table, flinching at the gunshots outside. Ramy made a noise about barricading the door, but the moment they moved to push the chairs forward, the door swung open.",
    "Robin felt a very brief, naive swell of relief before it became very clear Letty was not here to rescue them. She lifted the revolver, aimed at each one of them in turn. She seemed quite practised with the gun. Her arm did not tremble beneath its weight. And the sight was so absurd \u2013 their Letty, their prim English rose, wielding a weapon with such calm, deadly precision \u2013 that he wondered for a moment if he was hallucinating.",
    "\u2018Put your hands above your heads,\u2019 she said. Her voice was high and clear, like polished crystal. She sounded like an utter stranger. \u2018They won\u2019t hurt anyone, as long as you come quietly. If you don\u2019t resist. They\u2019ve killed the rest, but they\u2019ll take you alive. Unhurt.\u2019",
    "Several things happened at once. Victoire lunged for the envelope. Letty whipped the gun around. By instinct, Robin rushed towards her \u2013 he didn\u2019t know what he intended, only that he was sure Letty would hurt Victoire \u2013 but just as he approached her, Ramy shoved him to the side. He fell forward, tripping against a table leg\u2014",
    "\u2018No\u2014\u2019 Robin dropped to his knees. Ramy was limp, unmoving; he struggled to turn him over onto his back. \u2018No, Ramy, please\u2014\u2019 For a moment he thought Ramy was pretending, for how was this possible? He\u2019d been upright, moving and alive, just a second ago. The world could not end so abruptly; death could not be so swift.",
    "Robin patted Ramy\u2019s cheek, his neck, anything he could to provoke a reaction, but it was no use, his eyes would not open \u2013 why wouldn\u2019t they open? Surely this was a joke; he couldn\u2019t see any blood \u2013 but then he spotted it, a tiny red dot over Ramy\u2019s heart that rapidly blossomed outwards until it soaked through his shirt, his coat, through everything..",
    "Victoire stepped back from the fireplace. The papers crackled inside the flames, blackening to ash. Letty made no move to retrieve them. She stood stunned, eyes wide, the revolver hanging limply at her side.",
    "One day Robin would ask himself how his shock had turned so easily to rage; why his first reaction was not disbelief at this betrayal but black, consuming hatred. And the answer would elude and disturb him, for it tiptoed around a complicated tangle of love and jealousy that ensnared them all, for which they had no name or explanation, a truth they\u2019d only been starting to wake up to and now, after this, would never acknowledge.",
    "But just then, all he knew was red blurring out the edges of his vision, crowding out everything but Letty. He knew now how it felt to truly want a person dead, to want to tear them apart limb by limb, to hear them scream, to make them hurt. He understood now how murder felt, how rage felt, for this was it, the intent to kill he ought to have felt when he killed his father.",
    "Letty turned and fled. Robin rushed after her just as she retreated behind a mass of constables. He pushed against them; he didn\u2019t care about the danger, the truncheons and guns; he only wanted to get through to her, wanted to wring the life from her neck, to tear the white bitch to pieces.",
    "Strong arms wrenched him back. He felt a blunt force against the small of his back. He stumbled. He heard Victoire screaming but couldn\u2019t see her past the tangle of constables. Someone threw a cloth bag over his head. He flailed violently; his arm struck something solid, and the pressure against his back let up so slightly, but then something hard connected against his cheekbone, and the explosion of pain was so blinding it made him go limp. Someone cuffed his hands behind his back. Two sets of hands gripped his arms, hoisted him up, and dragged him out of the Reading Room.",
    "The struggle was over. The Old Library was quiet. He shook his head frantically, trying to shake the bag off, but all he caught were glimpses of overturned shelves and blackened carpet before someone yanked the bag tighter over his head. He saw nothing of Vimal, Anthony, Ilse, or Cathy. He could no longer hear Victoire\u2019s screaming.",
    "\u2018Quiet, you.\u2019 Someone pulled the hood away just long enough to stuff a rag in his mouth. Then he was plunged back into darkness. He saw nothing, heard nothing; just bleak, awful silence as they pulled him out of the ruins of the Old Library and into a waiting cab.",
    "Hours or days might have passed. He couldn\u2019t tell \u2013 he had no sense of time. He was not in his body, not in this cell; he curled miserably on the stone tiles and left the bruised and aching present behind. He was in the Old Library, helpless, watching over and over as Ramy jerked and lurched forward like someone had kicked him between the shoulder blades, as Ramy lay limp in his arms, as Ramy, despite everything he tried, did not stir again.",
    "Grief suffocated. Grief paralysed. Grief was a cruel, heavy boot pressed so hard against his chest that he could not breathe. Grief took him out of his body, made his injuries theoretical. He was bleeding, but he didn\u2019t know where from. He ached all over from the handcuffs digging into his wrists, from the hard stone floor against his limbs, from the way the police had flung him down as if trying to break all of his bones. He registered these hurts as factual, but he could not really feel them; he couldn\u2019t feel anything other than the singular, blinding pain of Ramy\u2019s loss.",
    "And he did not want to feel anything else, did not want to sink into his body and register its hurts, because that physical pain would mean he was alive, and because being alive meant that he had to move forward. But he could not go on. Not from this..",
    "He was stuck in the past. He revisited that memory a thousand times, the same way he had revisited his father\u2019s death. Only this time instead of convincing himself he had not intended to kill, he tried to convince himself of the possibility Ramy was alive. Had he really watched Ramy die? Or had he only heard the gunshot, seen the burst of blood and the fall? Was there breath left in Ramy\u2019s lungs, life left in his eyes? It seemed so unfair. No, it seemed impossible that Ramy could just leave this world so abruptly, that he could be so alive one moment and so still the next.",
    "And, certainly, Letty could not have been aiming for his heart. That was also impossible. She loved him, she loved him almost like Robin loved him \u2013 she\u2019d told him so, he remembered, and if that were true, then how could she look into Ramy\u2019s eyes and shoot to kill?",
    "Which meant Ramy might still be alive, might have survived against all odds, might have dragged himself from the carnage of the Old Library and found himself somewhere to hide, might yet recover if only someone found him in time, stanched the wound in time. Unlikely, but perhaps, perhaps, perhaps . . .",
    "He hoped. He hoped until hope became its own form of torture. The original meaning of hope was \u2018to desire\u2019, and Robin wanted with every ounce of his being a world that no longer was. He hoped until he thought he was going mad, until he started hearing fragments of his thoughts as if spoken outside of him, low, gruff words that echoed around the stone.",
    "This wasn\u2019t his imagination. He lifted his throbbing head, his cheek sticky with blood and tears. He glanced around, astonished. The stones were talking, whispering a thousand different testimonies, each too drowned out by the next for him to make out anything but passing phrases.",
    "Wincing, he stood up, pressed his face against the stone, and inched down the wall until he found the telltale glint of silver. The bar was inscribed with a classic Greek to Latin to English daisy-chain. The Greek epitaphion meant \u2018a funeral oration\u2019 \u2013 something spoken, something meant to be heard; the Latin epitaphium, similarly, referred to a eulogy. It was only the modern English epitaph that referred to something written and silent. The distorted translation gave voices to the written. He was surrounded by the confessions of the dead.",
    "What a uniquely terrible torture. What genius had thought this up? The point was, surely, to inundate him with the despair of every other poor soul who had been imprisoned here, to fill him with such unfathomable sadness that, when questioned, he would give up anyone and anything to make it stop.",
    "But these whispers were redundant. They did not darken his thoughts; they merely echoed them. Ramy was dead; Hermes was lost. The world could not go on. The future was only a vast expanse of black, and the only thing that gave him a shred of hope was the promise that someday, all this would end.",
    "Of course not, Robin almost said, but then the man walked closer, and the words died on his tongue. He wore the same features as the likeness in the frieze in the University College chapel: the same straight, aristocratic nose and intelligent, deep-set eyes. Robin had seen this face just once, over three years ago, in Professor Lovell\u2019s dining room. He\u2019d never forget it.",
    "\u2018You\u2019re Sterling.\u2019 Brilliant, famed Sterling Jones, nephew of Sir William Jones, the greatest translator of the age. His appearance here was so unexpected that for a moment Robin could only blink at him. \u2018Why\u2014\u2019",
    "Sterling drew two chairs into the room and sat down opposite Robin, crossing his legs at the knees. He tugged his jacket down to straighten it, then cocked his head at Robin. \u2018My word. You\u2019ve really grown alike. You\u2019re a bit easier on the eye, though. Griffin was all sneers and hackles. Like a wet dog.\u2019 He placed his hands on his knees and leaned forward. \u2018So you killed your father, did you? You don\u2019t look like a killer.\u2019",
    "But even as he said this, the last false binary he\u2019d constructed in his head \u2013 the one between scholars and the blades of empire \u2013 fell away. He recalled Griffin\u2019s words. He recalled his father\u2019s letters. Slave traders and soldiers. Ready killers, all of them.",
    "\u2018You are so like your brother.\u2019 Sterling shook his head. \u2018What\u2019s the Chinese expression? Badgers of the same mound, or jackals of the same tribe? Cheeky, impudent, and so unbearably self-righteous.\u2019 He folded his arms over his chest and leaned back, appraising him. \u2018Help me understand. I could never figure this out with Griffin. Simply \u2013 why? You got everything you could possibly want. You\u2019ll never have to work a day in your life \u2013 not real work, anyhow; it doesn\u2019t count when it\u2019s scholarship. You\u2019re swimming in riches.\u2019",
    "\u2018But you aren\u2019t your countrymen!\u2019 exclaimed Sterling. \u2018You are the exception. You are the lucky one, the elevated. Or do you really find more in common with those poor fools in Canton than your fellow Oxfordians?\u2019",
    "Robin saw no point in arguing further. It had been foolish to play along at all. Sterling Jones was just the same as Letty, except without the shallow sympathy of purported friendship. They both thought this was a matter of individual fortunes instead of systematic oppression, and neither could see outside the perspective of people who looked and spoke just like them.",
    "\u2018You know what they do is wrong,\u2019 Robin said tiredly. Enough with the euphemisms; he simply could not, would not believe that intelligent men like Sterling Jones, Professor Lovell, and Mr Baylis really believed their flimsy excuses were anything but that. Only men like them could justify the exploitation of other peoples and countries with clever rhetoric, verbal ripostes, and convoluted philosophical reasoning. Only men like them thought this was still a matter of debate. \u2018You know.\u2019",
    "Sterling scoffed. \u2018This world belongs to those who grasp. You and I both know that, that\u2019s how we got to Babel. Meanwhile your motherland is ruled by indolent, lazy aristocrats who are terrified by the very mention of a railroad.\u2019",
    "\u2018Very funny, Robin Swift. Do you think England should be punished, then, for daring to use those natural gifts given to us by God? Shall we leave the East in the hands of corrupt denigrates who would squander their riches on silks and concubines?\u2019 Sterling leaned forward. His blue eyes glittered. \u2018Or shall we lead? Britain hurtles towards a vast, glowing future. You could be part of that future. Why throw it all away?\u2019",
    "\u2018The university ripped us from our homes and made us believe that our futures could only consist of serving the Crown,\u2019 said Robin. \u2018The university tells us we are special, chosen, selected, when really we are severed from our motherlands and raised within spitting distance of a class we can never truly become a part of. The university turned us against our own and made us believe our only options were complicity or the streets. That was no favour, Sterling. It was cruelty. Don\u2019t ask me to love my master.\u2019",
    "Sterling glared at him. He was breathing very hard. It was the strangest thing, Robin thought, how much he\u2019d worked himself up. His cheeks were flushed, and his forehead was beginning to shine with sweat. Why, he wondered, did white people get so very upset when anyone disagreed with them?",
    "\u2018We have ways of extricating the truth. The word soothe derives from a Proto-Germanic root that means \u201ctruth\u201d. We daisy-chain it with the Swedish sand. It lulls you, lets you put your guard down, comforts you until you\u2019re singing.\u2019 Sterling leaned forward. \u2018But I\u2019ve always found that one quite boring.",
    "\u2018Do you know where the word agony comes from?\u2019 He fished inside his coat pocket, then pulled out a pair of silver handcuffs, which he laid across his knees. \u2018Greek, by way of Latin and later, Old French. The Greek ag\u014dnia means a contest \u2013 originally, a sports gathering between athletes. It gained the connotation of suffering much later. But I\u2019m translating from English back into the Greek, so the bar knows to induce suffering, not remove it. Clever, no?\u2019",
    "He gave the cuffs a satisfied smile. There was no malice in that smile \u2013 only a gleeful triumph that ancient languages could be hacked apart and reworked for his intended purpose. \u2018It took some experimenting before we got it right, but we\u2019ve now perfected the effect. It\u2019ll hurt, Robin Swift. It\u2019ll hurt like hell. I\u2019ve tried it before, just out of curiosity. It\u2019s not a surface-level pain, see; it\u2019s not like being stabbed with a blade, or even like being burned by flames. It\u2019s inside you.",
    "Like your wrists are shattering, over and over again, only there\u2019s no upper limit to the agony, because physically, you\u2019re fine \u2013 it\u2019s all in your head. It\u2019s quite awful. You\u2019ll strain against it, of course. The body can\u2019t help it, not against pain like that. But every time you struggle, the pain will double, and double again. Would you like to see for yourself?\u2019.",
    "He snapped the cuffs shut. Robin screamed. He could not help it. He\u2019d wanted to keep silent, to refuse Sterling the satisfaction, but the pain was so overwhelming he had no control, no sense of his body at all except for the pain, which was far worse than Sterling had described. It did not feel like his wrists were breaking. It felt as if someone were hammering thick iron spikes into his bones, straight into the marrow, and every time he writhed, flailing to break free, the pain intensified.",
    "But the pain only grew. Sterling hadn\u2019t lied; there was no limit. Every time he thought that this was it, that if he suffered one more moment of this then he would die, it somehow amplified. He had not known human flesh could feel such pain.",
    "Restraint. Repression. Had he not practised this his entire life? Let the pain slide off you like raindrops, without acknowledgment, without reaction, because to pretend it is not happening is the only way to survive.",
    "Sweat dripped down his forehead. He fought to push past the blinding agony, to gain a sense of his arms and hold them still. It was the most difficult thing he\u2019d ever done; it felt like he was forcing his own wrists under a hammer.",
    "\u2018Impressive,\u2019 said Sterling. \u2018See how long you can keep that up. Meanwhile, I\u2019ve got something else to show you.\u2019 He pulled another bar out from his pocket and held it down over Robin\u2019s face. The left side read: \u03c6\u03c1\u03ae\u03bd. \u2018I don\u2019t suppose you did Ancient Greek? Griffin\u2019s was very poor, but I\u2019m told you\u2019re the better student. You\u2019ll know what phren refers to, then \u2013 the seat of intellect and emotion. Only the Greeks didn\u2019t think it resided in the mind. Homer, for instance, describes the phren as being located in the chest.\u2019 He placed the bar into Robin\u2019s front pocket.",
    "The physical torture was not so bad \u2013 more of a hard pressure than acute pain. But the moment Sterling\u2019s knuckles touched his chest, Robin\u2019s mind exploded: feelings and memories flooded to the fore, everything he\u2019d hidden, everything he feared and dreaded, all the truths he dared not acknowledge. He was a babbling idiot, he had no idea what he was saying; words in Chinese and English both spilled out of him without reason or order.",
    "\u2018Oh, no, Robin Swift. You don\u2019t get off that easily. We don\u2019t want you dead; that defies the point.\u2019 Sterling pulled a watch out of his pocket, examined it, and then cocked his ear towards the door as if listening for something. Seconds later, Robin heard Victoire scream. \u2018Can\u2019t say the same for her.\u2019",
    "Robin gathered his legs beneath him and launched himself at Sterling\u2019s waist. Sterling stepped to the side. Robin crashed to the ground, his cheek slamming painfully against stone. His wrists pulled against the cuffs, and his arms once again exploded into pain that did not stop until he curled in on himself, gasping, pouring every ounce of his focus into keeping still.",
    "\u2018Here\u2019s how it works.\u2019 Sterling dangled the watch chain over Robin\u2019s eyes. \u2018Tell me everything you know about the Hermes Society, and all of this stops. I\u2019ll remove the cuffs, and I\u2019ll set your friend free. Everything will be all right.\u2019",
    "There\u2019s Griffin, spoke a voice. There are those who were in the envelope, there are countless others you don\u2019t know about. And that was the point \u2013 he didn\u2019t know who was still out there or what they were doing, and he could not risk revealing anything that put them in danger. He\u2019d made that mistake once before; he could not fail Hermes again.",
    "Robin threw himself at Sterling\u2019s legs. This time it worked; he\u2019d caught Sterling by surprise. They crashed to the floor, Robin above Sterling, cuffed hands above his head. He brought his fists down onto Sterling\u2019s forehead, his shoulders, anywhere he could reach.",
    "The pain in Robin\u2019s wrists redoubled. He couldn\u2019t see. He couldn\u2019t breathe. Sterling struggled out from beneath him. He toppled sideways, choking. Tears streamed down his cheeks. Sterling stood over him for a moment, breathing hard. Then he drew his boot back and aimed a vicious kick at Robin\u2019s sternum.",
    "Pain; white-hot, blinding pain. Robin could perceive nothing else. He didn\u2019t have the breath to scream. He had no bodily control at all, no dignity; his eyes were blank, his mouth slack, leaking drool onto the floor.",
    "Then Robin was alone again. Sterling did not say when he would return, or what would happen to Robin next. There was only the vast expanse of time and the black grief that engulfed it. He wept until he was hollow. He screamed until it hurt to breathe.",
    "Sometimes the waves of pain subsided ever so slightly and he thought he could organize his thoughts, take stock of his situation, ponder his next move. What came next? Was victory on the table any longer, or was there only survival? But Ramy and Victoire permeated everything. Every time he saw the slightest glimpse of the future, he remembered they would not be in it, and then the tears flowed again, and the suffocating boot of grief came down again on his chest.",
    "He considered dying. It would not be so hard; he needed only to strike his head against stone with enough effort or figure out some way to strangle himself with his cuffs. The pain of it did not frighten him. His whole body felt numb; it seemed impossible that he might feel anything ever again except the overwhelming sense of drowning \u2013 and perhaps, he thought, death was the only way to break the surface.",
    "He might not have to do it himself. When they\u2019d wrung everything they could from his mind, wouldn\u2019t they try him in court and then hang him? In his youth he had once glimpsed a hanging at Newcastle; he\u2019d seen the crowd gathered around the gallows during one of his jaunts around the city and, not knowing what he was seeing, drawn closer to the crush. There had been three men standing in a line on the platform. He remembered the whack of the panel giving way, the abrupt snap of their necks. He remembered hearing someone mutter their disappointment that the victims had not kicked.",
    "But what in God\u2019s name was he still alive for? Robin could not see how anything he did from now on mattered. His despair was total. They had lost, they had lost with such crushing completeness, and there was nothing left. If he clung to life for the days or weeks he had left, it was solely for Ramy\u2019s sake, because he did not deserve what was easy.",
    "Time crept on. Robin drifted between waking and sleep. Pain and grief made it impossible to truly rest. But he was tired, so tired, and his thoughts spiralled, became vivid, nightmarish memories. He was on the Hellas again, speaking the words that set all this in motion; he was staring down at his father, watching blood bubble over that ruin of a chest. And it was such a perfect tragedy, wasn\u2019t it? An age-old story, parricide.",
    "The Greeks loved parricide, Mr Chester had been fond of saying; they loved it for its infinite narrative potential, its invocations of legacy, pride, honour, and dominance. They loved the way it struck every possible emotion because it so deviously inverted the most basic tenet of human existence. One being creates another, moulds and influences it in its own image. The son becomes, then replaces, the father; Kronos destroys Ouranos, Zeus destroys Kronos and, eventually, becomes him.",
    "But Robin had never envied his father, never wanted anything of his except his recognition, and he hated to see himself reflected in that cold, dead face. No, not dead \u2013 reanimated, haunting; Professor Lovell leered at him, and behind him, opium burned on Canton\u2019s shores, hot and booming and sweet..",
    "\u2018Funniest thing, isn\u2019t it? Sit up.\u2019 Griffin knelt down behind him and set to work on Robin\u2019s cuffs. \u2018Once you said it for the first time, I finally got it. Like I\u2019ve been waiting for someone to say those words my whole life. Christ, kid, who did this to you?\u2019",
    "\u2018Ah, damn it.\u2019 Griffin rummaged around in his bag and pulled out a large pair of shears. \u2018I\u2019m cutting through, hold still.\u2019 Robin felt an agonizing, intense pressure \u2013 and then nothing. His hands sprang free \u2013 still cuffed, but no longer bolted together.",
    "\u2018We have our ways.\u2019 Robin noticed then that Griffin\u2019s right hand shone mottled pale, red, and angry. It looked like a burn scar. \u2018Anthony didn\u2019t elaborate, he only sent an emergency signal, but I reckoned it was bad. Then all the rumours from the tower said they\u2019d hauled you lot here, so I skipped the Old Library \u2013 would have been dangerous, regardless \u2013 and came here. Good bet. Where is Anthony?\u2019",
    "\u2018I think they\u2019re all dead.\u2019 Robin felt wretched; he could not meet Griffin\u2019s eyes. \u2018Cathy, Vimal, Ilse \u2013 everyone in the house \u2013 I didn\u2019t see them fall, but I heard the shooting, and then I didn\u2019t see them again.\u2019",
    "\u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019 Robin said miserably. She could be lying dead in her cell. They could have already dragged her body outside, dumped it in a shallow grave. He couldn\u2019t speak the words to explain; that would shatter him.",
    "\u2018Got rid of them.\u2019 Griffin tapped another bar in his belt. \u2018A daisy-chain riff on the word explode. The Latin expl\u014ddere is a theatre term \u2013 it refers to driving an actor off the stage by clapping one\u2019s hands. From there we get the Old English meaning \u201cto reject or drive away with loud noise\u201d. It\u2019s not until the modern English that we get a detonation.\u2019 He looked very pleased with himself. \u2018My Latin\u2019s better than my Chinese.\u2019",
    "They searched every cell in the hall for Victoire. Most were empty, and Robin felt a growing dread as they moved down the doors. He did not want to look; he did not want to see the blood-streaked floor \u2013 or worse, her limp body lying where they\u2019d left it, a bullet wound through her head.",
    "\u2018It\u2019s Griffin. Robin\u2019s here too. Don\u2019t fret, we\u2019re going to get you out.\u2019 Griffin reached into his pocket and pulled out what looked like an improvised hand grenade \u2013 a ceramic sphere a quarter the size of a cricket ball with a fuse sticking out one end.",
    "Robin waved the smoke from his face, coughing. The door hadn\u2019t blasted apart \u2013 any explosion that large would have surely killed Victoire. But it had made a hole at the bottom just large enough for a child to crawl through. Griffin kicked at the charred wood until several large pieces fell away. \u2018Victoire, can you\u2014\u2019",
    "She crawled out, coughing. Griffin and Robin seized her by each arm and pulled her through the rest of the way. When at last she slid free, she clambered to her knees and threw her arms around Robin. \u2018I thought\u2014\u2019",
    "\u2018Me too,\u2019 he murmured, hugging her tight. She was, thank God, largely unharmed. Her wrists were somewhat chafed, but free of cuffs, and there was no blood on her, no gaping bullet wounds. Sterling had been bluffing.",
    "He knew what she meant. She had chosen to let him die. This did not hurt as much as it should have. Rather, it clarified things; the stakes before them, the insignificance of their lives against the cause they\u2019d chosen. He saw her begin to apologize, and then catch herself \u2013 good, he thought; she had nothing to be sorry for, for between them only one had refused to break.",
    "Robin glanced out of the window at the end of the hall. They were quite far up, he realized. He\u2019d thought they were in the city gaol on Gloucester Green, but that building was only two storeys high. The ground looked so far away from where they stood. \u2018Where are we?\u2019",
    "Griffin descended first, then Victoire, and then Robin. Climbing down was far harder than Griffin made it look; Robin slid too quickly down the last ten feet as his arms gave out, and the rope left searing burns on his palms. Outside, it was apparent Griffin had caused much more than a simple diversion. The entire north front of Oxford Castle was ablaze, and flames and smoke were quickly spreading through the building.",
    "Had Griffin done this all himself? Robin glanced sideways at his brother, and it was like seeing a stranger. Griffin became new in his imagination every time he encountered him, and this version was most frightening, this hard, sharp-edged man who shot and killed and burned without flinching. It was the first time he\u2019d ever connected his brother\u2019s abstract commitments to violence with its material effects. And they were awesome. Robin didn\u2019t know if he feared him, or admired his sheer ability.",
    "Griffin tossed them two plain black cloaks from his satchel \u2013 from a distance, they\u2019d look vaguely like the constables\u2019 cloaks \u2013 then shepherded them along the side of the castle towards the main street. \u2018Move quickly and don\u2019t look behind you,\u2019 he muttered. \u2018They\u2019re all distracted \u2013 be calm, be fast, we\u2019ll be out of here just fine.\u2019",
    "And for a moment, it did seem like escape really could be that easy. The whole of the castle square looked deserted; all sentries were preoccupied with the flames and the high stone walls cast plenty of shadows in which to hide.",
    "\u2018I see you\u2019ve reached new heights of destruction.\u2019 Sterling gestured vaguely at the castle. In the dim lamplight, with blood coating his pale hair and white-grey dust all over his coat, he looked quite deranged. \u2018Wasn\u2019t enough for you to kill Evie?\u2019",
    "There was history here, Robin saw. Something beyond belonging to the same cohort. Griffin and Sterling spoke with the intimacy of old friends caught in some complicated tangle of love and hatred to which he was not privy, something that had brewed over many years. He didn\u2019t know their story, but it was obvious that Griffin and Sterling had been anticipating this confrontation for quite some time.",
    "It was over so quickly Robin hardly registered what was happening. Griffin whipped out his revolver. Sterling pointed his gun at Griffin\u2019s chest. They must have pulled their triggers simultaneously, for the noise that split the night sounded like a single shot. They both collapsed at once.",
    "Victoire screamed. Robin dropped to his knees, pulling at Griffin\u2019s coat, patting frantically at his chest until he found the wet, growing patch of blood over his left shoulder. Shoulder wounds were not fatal, were they? Robin tried to remember what little he\u2019d gleaned from adventure stories \u2013 one might bleed to death, but not if they got help in time, not if someone stanched the bleeding long enough to bind the wound, or stitch it, or whatever it was doctors did to fix a bullet through the shoulder\u2014",
    "\u4fee. To fix. Not merely to heal, but to repair, to patch over the damage; undo the wound with brute, mechanical reparation. The distortion was subtle, but it was there, it could work. And something was happening \u2013 he felt it under his hand, the knitting together of broken flesh, a crackling noise of bone regrowing. But the blood wouldn\u2019t stop; it spilled over his hands, coating the bar, coating the silver. Something was wrong \u2013 the flesh was moving but it wouldn\u2019t patch together; the bullet was in the way, and it was too deep for him to prise out. \u2018No,\u2019 Robin begged.",
    "\u2018Go.\u2019 Griffin\u2019s face had turned paper-white, almost green. \u03c7\u03bb\u03c9\u03c1\u03cc\u03c2, Robin thought stupidly; it was the only thing his mind could process, a memory of a frivolous debate over the translation of colour. He found himself remembering in detail how Professor Craft had questioned why they kept translating \u03c7\u03bb\u03c9\u03c1\u03cc\u03c2 as \u2018green\u2019, when Homer had also applied it to fresh twigs, to honey, to faces pale with fright. Was the bard merely blind, then? No.",
    "\u2018No, Robin, listen.\u2019 Griffin spasmed in pain; Robin held him tight, unable to do anything more. \u2018There\u2019s more than you think. Hermes \u2013 the safe room, Victoire knows where, she knows what to do \u2013 and in my satchel, w\u00fax\u00edng, there\u2019s\u2014\u2019",
    "\u2018No.\u2019 Robin slid his arms under Griffin\u2019s torso. But Griffin was so heavy, and his own arms so weak. Blood spilled all over his hands. The smell of it, salty; his vision went fuzzy. He tried pulling his brother upright. They lurched to the side.",
    "The shot boomed like a cannon. Griffin convulsed and lay still. Robin doubled over, screaming, but there was no sound to his anguish, no shape to his pain; he was incorporeal, voiceless, and though he suffered the kind of shattering grief that demanded shrieking, beating, a ripping of the world \u2013 and if not the world, then himself \u2013 he could not move; until the square was clear, all he could do was wait, and watch.",
    "When at last the guards had gone, Griffin\u2019s body had turned a ghastly white. His eyes were open, glassy. Robin pressed his fingers against his neck, looking for a pulse and knowing he\u2019d find none; the blast had been so direct, from such a short range.",
    "He stood. What an awful tableau, he thought. Griffin\u2019s and Sterling\u2019s bodies lay adjacent on the ground, blood pooling beneath each one, running together under the rain. Some kind of love story had concluded on this square \u2013 some vicious triangle of desire, resentment, jealousy, and hatred had opened with Evie\u2019s death and closed with Griffin\u2019s. Its details were murky, would never be known to Robin in full;* all he knew, with certainty, was that this was not the first time Griffin and Sterling had tried to kill each other, only the first time one of them had succeeded.",
    "It felt so wrong to leave them like this. Robin wanted at least to pull his brother\u2019s body away, to lay it somewhere quiet and private, to close his eyes and place his hands over his chest. But there was only time now to run, to put the scene of the massacre behind.",
    "Robin did not remember how they escaped unnoticed from Oxford Castle. His mind had fled with Griffin\u2019s death; he could not make decisions; he could hardly register where he was. The most he could do was to put one foot in front of the other, blindly following Victoire wherever she led them: into forests, through bushes and brambles, down a riverbank where they waited, huddled together in the mud, as dogs raced past, barking; then up onto a winding back road into the centre of town.",
    "\u2018But why aren\u2019t we heading to the Cotswolds?\u2019 He didn\u2019t know why his mind had seized upon the Cotswold Hills, northwest of Oxford, filled with rolling empty plains and forests. They just seemed like the natural place to flee to. Perhaps he\u2019d read it in a penny dreadful once, and had assumed the Cotswolds were a place for fugitives ever since. Certainly they seemed better than the heart of Oxford.",
    "Robin could hear dogs barking in the distance as they approached the Radcliffe quadrangle. The police must have launched a city-wide manhunt; surely there were men and dogs trawling every street for them. Yet suddenly, absurdly, he felt no urgency to flee. They had Griffin\u2019s w\u00fax\u00edng bar in hand; they could disappear at any moment.",
    "And Oxford at night was still so serene, still seemed like a place where they were safe, where arrest was impossible. It still looked like a city carved out of the past; of ancient spires, pinnacles, and turrets; of soft moonlight on old stones and worn, cobbled roads. Its buildings were still so reassuringly heavy, solid, ancient and eternal. The lights that shone through arched windows still promised warmth, old books, and hot tea within; still suggested an idyllic scholar\u2019s life, where ideas were abstract entertainments that could be bandied about without consequences.",
    "But the dream was shattered. That dream had always been founded on a lie. None of them had ever stood a chance of truly belonging here, for Oxford wanted only one kind of scholar, the kind born and bred to cycle through posts of power it had created for itself. Everyone else it chewed up and discarded. These towering edifices were built with coin from the sale of slaves, and the silver that kept them running came blood-stained from the mines of Potos\u00ed.",
    "It was smelted in choking forges where native labourers were paid a pittance, before making its way on ships across the Atlantic to where it was shaped by translators ripped from their countries, stolen to this faraway land and never truly allowed to go home..",
    "He\u2019d been so foolish ever to think he could build a life here. There was no straddling the line; he knew that now. No stepping back and forth between two worlds, no seeing and not seeing, no holding a hand over one eye or the other like a child playing a game. You were either a part of this institution, one of the bricks that held it up, or you weren\u2019t.",
    "Their mistake had been so obvious. They had assumed that Oxford might not betray them. Their dependence on Babel was ingrained, unconscious. On some level, they had still believed that the university, and their status as its scholars, might protect them. They had assumed, in spite of every indication otherwise, that those with the most to gain from the Empire\u2019s continued expansion might find it within themselves to do the right thing.",
    "He almost laughed at the absurdity. Power did not lie in the tip of a pen. Power did not work against its own interests. Power could only be brought to heel by acts of defiance it could not ignore. With brute, unflinching force. With violence.",
    "It was only an idea, a wish more than anything, but it was a beginning. And it took root and grew inside them, unfurled until it became less a ludicrous fantasy and more a question of logistics, of how and when.",
    "Across the town students were fast asleep. Next to them, tomes by Plato and Locke and Montesquieu waited to be read, discussed, gesticulated about; theoretical rights like freedom and liberty would be debated between those who already enjoyed them, stale concepts that, upon their readers\u2019 graduation ceremonies, would promptly be forgotten.",
    "That life, and all of its preoccupations, seemed insane to him now; he could not believe there was ever a time when his greatest concerns were what colour neckties to order from Randall\u2019s, or what insults to shout at houseboats hogging the river during rowing practice. It was all such frippery, fluff, trivial distractions built over a foundation of ongoing, unimaginable cruelty..",
    "Robin gazed at the curve of Babel against the moonlight, at the faint silver glow cast off by its many reinforcements. He had a sudden, very clear vision of the tower in ruins. He wanted it to shatter. He wanted it to, for once, feel the pain that had made possible its rarefied existence. \u2018I want it to crumble.\u2019",
    "Harsh, perhaps. Cold, blunt, severe: all the words one might use to describe a girl who demanded from the world the same things a man would. But only because severity was the only way to make people take her seriously, because it was better to be feared and disliked than to be considered a sweet, pretty, stupid pet; and because academia respected steel, could tolerate cruelty, but could never accept weakness.",
    "Letty had fought and clawed for everything she had. Oh, one wouldn\u2019t know it from looking at her, this fair English rose, this admiral\u2019s daughter raised on a Brighton estate with half a dozen servants at hand and two hundred pounds per annum to whoever married her. Letitia Price has everything, said the ugly jealous girls at London balls. But Letty was born second after a boy, Lincoln, the apple of her father\u2019s eye.",
    "Meanwhile her father, the admiral, could barely stand to look at her, for when he did all he saw was a shadow of the frail and late Mrs Amelia Price, killed by childbirth in a room humid with blood that smelled like the ocean..",
    "Lincoln was meant for Oxford, Letty for an early marriage. Lincoln received the rotation of tutors, all recent Oxford graduates who hadn\u2019t landed a parish elsewhere; the fancy pens, creamy stationery, and thick, glossy books on birthdays and Christmases. As for Letty \u2013 well, her father\u2019s opinion on women\u2019s literacy was that they needed only to be able to sign the marriage certificate.",
    "But it was Letty who had the talent for languages, who absorbed Greek and Latin as easily as she did English. She learned from reading on her own, and from sitting with her ear pressed to the door during Lincoln\u2019s tutoring sessions. Her formidable mind retained information like a steel trap. She held grammar rules the way other women held grudges. She approached language with a determined, mathematical rigour, and she broke down the thorniest of Latin constructions through sheer force of will.",
    "It was Letty who drilled her brother late at night when he couldn\u2019t remember his vocabulary lists, who finished his translations and corrected his compositions when he got bored and went off to ride or hunt or whatever it was boys did outdoors..",
    "But this was not in her stars. She tried to be happy for Lincoln, to project her hopes and dreams onto her brother like so many women of that era did. If Lincoln became an Oxford don, then perhaps she might become his secretary. But his mind was simply a brick wall. He hated his lessons; he despised his tutors. He thought his readings boring. All he ever wanted was to be outdoors; he could not sit still in front of a book for more than a minute before he began to fidget. And she simply couldn\u2019t understand him, why someone with such opportunities would reject the chance to use them.",
    "She loved her brother, she did. But she could not stand his ingratitude, the way he scorned all the gifts he\u2019d been given by the world. And it felt like justice, almost, when it turned out that Oxford suited Lincoln very badly. His tutors at Balliol wrote to Admiral Price with complaints of drinking, gambling, staying out past curfew. Lincoln wrote home asking for money.",
    "His letters to Letty were brief, tantalizing, offering glimpses of a world he clearly did not appreciate \u2013 classes a snooze, don\u2019t bother to go \u2013 not during rowing season, anyhow, you should come up and see us at Bumps next spring. In the beginning, Admiral Price wrote this off as natural, as growing pains. Young men, living away from home for the first time, always took some time to adjust \u2013 and why shouldn\u2019t they sow their wild oats? Lincoln would pick up his books, in time..",
    "But things only got worse. Lincoln\u2019s marks never improved. The letters from his tutors were less patient now, more threatening. When Lincoln came home for holidays during his third year, something had changed. A rot had set in, Letty saw. Something permanent, dark. Her brother\u2019s face was puffy, his speech slow, biting, and bitter. He said scarcely a word to either of them all vacation. Afternoons he spent alone in his room, working steadily through a bottle of scotch.",
    "Evenings he either went out and didn\u2019t come back until the early hours, or he quarrelled with his father, and though the two of them locked the door to the study, their angry voices pierced every room in the house. You\u2019re a disgrace, said Admiral Price. I hate it there, said Lincoln. I\u2019m not happy. And it\u2019s your dream, not mine..",
    "\u2018Of course I\u2019m jealous. You have everything. Everything, Lincoln. And I don\u2019t understand what\u2019s impelled you to squander it. If your friends are a drag, cut them off. If the courses are difficult, I\u2019ll help you \u2013 I\u2019ll come with you, I\u2019ll look over every paper you write\u2014\u2019",
    "The next morning a constable knocked at their door and asked if this was the residence of Admiral Price, and if he would come with them, please, to identify a body. The driver never saw him, they said. Didn\u2019t even know he was under the cart until this morning, when the horses had a fright. It was dark, it was raining, and Lincoln had been drunk, traipsing across the road \u2013 the admiral could sue, as was his right, but they doubted the court would be on his side. It was an accident.",
    "Once admitted, she still suffered a thousand and one humiliations at Oxford. Professors talked down to her as if she were stupid. Clerks kept trying to glance through her shirt. She had an infuriatingly long walk to every class because the faculty forced women to live in a building nearly two miles north, where the landlady seemed to confuse her tenants with housemaids and yelled if they refused to do the sweeping. Scholars would reach past her at faculty parties to shake Robin\u2019s or Ramy\u2019s hand; if she spoke up, they pretended she did not exist.",
    "If Ramy corrected a professor, he was bold and brilliant; if Letty did the same she was aggravating. If she wanted to take a book out of the Bodleian, she needed Ramy or Robin present to give permission. If she wanted to get around in the dark, alone and unafraid, she had to dress and walk like a man..",
    "None of this came as a surprise. She was, after all, a woman scholar in a country whose word for madness derived from the word for a womb. It was infuriating. Her friends were always going on about the discrimination they faced as foreigners, but why didn\u2019t anyone care that Oxford was equally cruel to women?",
    "But in spite of all that, look at them \u2013 they were here, they were thriving, defying the odds. They\u2019d got into the castle. They had a place here, where they could transcend their birth. They had, if they seized it, the opportunity to become some of the lauded exceptions. And why would they be anything but unfailingly, desperately grateful?",
    "But suddenly, after Canton, they were all speaking in a language that she couldn\u2019t understand. Suddenly Letty was on the outside, and she couldn\u2019t bear it. She couldn\u2019t seem to crack the code, no matter how she tried, because every time she asked, the response was always Isn\u2019t it obvious, Letty? Don\u2019t you see? No, she didn\u2019t see. She found their principles absurd, the height of foolishness. She thought the Empire inevitable. The future immutable. And resistance pointless.",
    "Still, she\u2019d helped them, protected them, and kept their secrets. She loved them. She would have killed for them. And she tried not to believe the worst things about them, the things her upbringing would have had her think. They were not savages. They were not lesser, not soft-minded ingrates. They were only \u2013 sadly, dreadfully \u2013 misguided.",
    "Why could they not see how fortunate they were? To be allowed into these hallowed halls, to be lifted from their squalid upbringings into the dazzling heights of the Royal Institute of Translation! All of them had fought tooth and nail to win a seat in a classroom at Oxford. She was dazzled by her luck every day she sat in the Bodleian, thumbing through books that, without her Translator\u2019s Privileges, she could not have requested from the stacks. Letty had defied fate to get here; they all had.",
    "But there are larger things at stake, they told her (condescending, patronizing; as if she were an infant, as if she knew nothing at all). It\u2019s a matter of global injustice, Letty. The plunder of the rest of the world.",
    "She tried again to put aside her prejudices, to keep an open mind, to learn what it was that bothered them so. Time and time again she found her ethics questioned, and she reiterated her positions, as if proving she was not indeed a bad person. Of course she did not support this war. Of course she was against all kinds of prejudice and exploitation. Of course she sided with the abolitionists.",
    "But then they were talking about blackmail. About kidnapping, rioting, blowing up a shipyard. This was vindictive, violent, awful. And she couldn\u2019t bear it \u2013 watching that horrible Griffin Lovell speak, that delighted glimmer in his eyes, and watching Ramy, her Ramy, nodding along. She could not believe it, what he\u2019d become. What they\u2019d all become.",
    "There was no future down this path. She saw this now. She\u2019d been duped, strung along in this sickening charade, but this ended in only two ways: prison or the hangman. She was the only one there who wasn\u2019t too mad to see it. And though it killed her, she had to act with resolve \u2013 for if she could not save her friends, she had at least to save herself.",
    "A hidden door by the Vaults & Garden supply cellar revealed a cramped dirt tunnel, just large enough for them to wriggle through on their hands and knees. It felt endless. They inched forth, groping blindly. Robin wished for a light, but they had no candle, no kindling or flint; they could only trust in Anthony\u2019s word and crawl, their shallow breaths echoing around them. At last, the ceiling of the tunnel sloped upwards, and a rush of cool air bathed their clammy skin.",
    "Someone had been here recently. A loaf of bread sat on the desk, still so fresh that it was soft to the touch, and a half-melted candle beside it. Victoire rooted in the drawers until she found a box of matches, and then held the lit candle up to the room. \u2018So this is where Griffin hid.\u2019",
    "The safe room felt uncannily familiar to Robin, though it took him a moment to realize why. The room\u2019s layout \u2013 the desk beneath the grated window, the cot tucked neatly in the corner, the double bookshelves on the opposite wall \u2013 was a precise match of the dormitories on Magpie Lane. Here below Oxford, Griffin \u2013 consciously or not \u2013 had tried to re-create his college days.",
    "\u2018I think you\u2019re right.\u2019 He sat down beside her. Only now did he feel the exhaustion, seeping up his legs and into his chest. All the adrenaline of their escape had ebbed, now that they were safe, hidden in the belly of the earth. He wanted to keel over and never wake up.",
    "They sat side by side and cleaned themselves in silence. They were covered in an astonishing amount of grime; they went through one shirt each, and then another. Somehow, Griffin\u2019s blood had got not only on Robin\u2019s hands and arms but also across his cheeks, behind his ears, and up in the hollows where his neck met his ears, caked under layers of dust and dirt.",
    "They took turns wiping at each other\u2019s faces. The simple, tactile act felt good; it gave them something to focus on, distracted from all the words that hung heavy and unsaid. It felt good not trying to give them voice. They could not articulate them anyhow; they were not discrete thoughts but black, suffocating clouds. They were both thinking of Ramy and Griffin and Anthony and everyone else who\u2019d been abruptly, brutally torn from this world. But they could not touch that abyss of grief.",
    "At last, they dropped the dirty rags on the floor and leaned back against the wall, against each other. The damp air was cold, and there was no fireplace. They sat close, pulling the flimsy blanket tight around their shoulders. It was a long while before either of them spoke.",
    "Such a heavy question, uttered in such a small voice. What could they do now? They had spoken of making Babel burn, but how in God\u2019s name was that in their power? The Old Library was destroyed. Their friends were dead. Everyone bolder and better than them was dead. But the two of them were still here, and it was their duty to ensure their friends had not died in vain.",
    "They began searching the room for clues. Victoire took the cabinet, Robin the desk. Inside the desk drawers were stacks upon stacks of Griffin\u2019s notes and letters. These he held up to the flickering candle, squinting. It made Robin\u2019s chest ache to read Griffin\u2019s handwriting in English \u2013 a cramped, spidered style that looked so similar to Robin\u2019s own, and to their father\u2019s. These letters, all these narrow, bold, and crowded lines, spoke of a frenetic but meticulous writer, were a glimpse into a version of Griffin that Robin had never known.",
    "And Griffin\u2019s network had been so much vaster than he\u2019d suspected. He saw correspondence addressed to recipients in Boston, in New York, in Cairo, in Singapore. But the names were always coded, always obvious literary references like \u2018Mr Pickwick\u2019 and \u2018King Ahab\u2019 or names so generically English like \u2018Mr Brown\u2019 and \u2018Mr Pink\u2019 that they could not possibly be real.",
    "She hesitated a moment before handing it over. The envelope was thin and sealed. There on the back was his name, Robin Swift, dashed out in Griffin\u2019s forceful scrawl. But when had he found the time to write this? It couldn\u2019t have been after Anthony brought them to Hermes; Griffin hadn\u2019t known where they were back then. It could only have been written after Robin had cut ties with Hermes, after Robin had declared he wanted nothing to do with him.",
    "\u2018I \u2013 I don\u2019t think I can.\u2019 He passed it back to her. He felt terrified of the contents; it made his breath quicken to even hold it in his hand. He could not face his brother\u2019s judgment. Not now. \u2018Will you keep it for me?\u2019",
    "They resumed rooting through Griffin\u2019s belongings. Apart from letters, Griffin had kept an impressive array of weapons \u2013 knives, garrotes, a number of silver bars, and at least three pistols. Robin refused to touch them; Victoire surveyed the collection, fingers skimming the barrels, before selecting one and tucking it into her belt.",
    "But there was no list of contacts, no clues to other safe houses or possible allies. Griffin had shrouded everything in code, had created a network so invisible that, upon his death, it could never be reconstructed.",
    "Robin reached for it, hoping wildly \u2013 yes, there it was, the familiar glint of silver embedded in the bottom. The beacon, Anthony had yelled. He thought of the burn on Griffin\u2019s hand, of how Griffin had known, even miles away, that something awful had happened.",
    "Griffin had made this. Li\u00e1o, in Mandarin, could mean \u2018to burn\u2019 or \u2018to illuminate\u2019. It could also refer to a signal lamp. There was a second, smaller silver bar inscribed above the first. B\u0113acen, it read. It looked like Latin, but Robin, raking his memory, couldn\u2019t come up with its precise meaning or origin. Germanic, perhaps?*",
    "They rummaged through the desk for pen and paper, then set about composing their message. The remaining oil in the lamp looked dangerously low; the wick was burnt down to a stub. Their message would have to be as succinct and unambiguous as possible. There could be no questioning what they meant. When they\u2019d agreed on what to say, Victoire held the candle to the lamp. There was a tentative flicker, then a sudden whoosh, until flames over a foot tall leapt and danced before their eyes.",
    "They weren\u2019t sure about the mechanics of the beacon. Robin had spoken the Mandarin match-pair out loud, but they could only hope that the second, mysterious match-pair was designed to endure in effect. They\u2019d come up with an exhaustive list of every method they could think to try. They recited the message into the flame. They clapped it in Morse code. They repeated the code, this time by thrusting a metal rod through the flame, so it flickered with every dot and dash. Finally, as the oil began sputtering, they fed the paper into the lamp.",
    "The effect was immediate. The fire tripled in size; long tongues lashed outwards and then back in around the paper, like some demonic creature devouring their words. The paper did not burn or crumple; it simply vanished. A moment later, the oil ran out, the flames sputtered to nothing, and the room dimmed.",
    "\u2018I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know if anyone\u2019s even listening.\u2019 Robin set the lamp down. He felt unbearably tired, his limbs like lead. He did not know what they\u2019d just set into motion. Part of him never wanted to find out, wanted to curl up in this cool, dark space and disappear. He had a duty, he knew, to finish the job, and when tomorrow came, he would summon what strength he had left to face it. But for now, he wanted to sleep like the dead. \u2018I suppose we\u2019ll see.\u2019",
    "At daybreak they sneaked across town to the Old Library. Dozens of policemen stood stationed around the building \u2013 perhaps they were lying in wait, to see if anyone was foolish enough to return. Robin and Victoire crept forth cautiously from the forest behind the yard. This was stupid, yes, but they could not resist the urge to tally the damage. They\u2019d hoped they might have a chance to creep inside and retrieve some supplies, but the police presence was too thick for them to pull it off.",
    "The Old Library was utterly destroyed. The whole back had been blown away, a gaping wound exposing the library\u2019s naked insides in a way that felt cruel and humiliating. The shelves were half-bare. What books had not been burnt in the explosions were stacked up in wheelbarrows all around the building to be carted away, Robin assumed, for analysis by Babel\u2019s own scholars. He doubted most of that work would ever see the light of day.",
    "Only when he crept closer did he see that bodies still lay in the rubble. He saw a pale arm, half-buried beneath fallen bricks. He saw a shoe buckle attached to a charred shin. Near the side of the Old Library he saw a mass of hair, black, dust-covered. He turned away before he could glimpse the face beneath.",
    "He stood up. He didn\u2019t know what he meant to do \u2013 pull them into the forest one by one? Dig their graves right by the library? Place a cloth, at least, over their open, staring eyes? He didn\u2019t know, only it felt so wrong to leave them there, exposed and vulnerable.",
    "They hadn\u2019t carted them to the morgue. Hadn\u2019t even covered them. They\u2019d simply left the dead where they\u2019d fallen, bleeding across the bricks and pages, were simply stepping around them on their way to excavate the library. Was this their petty revenge, retribution for a lifetime of inconvenience? Or did they simply not care?",
    "The world has to break, he thought. Someone has to answer for this. Someone has to bleed. But Victoire yanked him down the way they\u2019d come, and her vicelike grip was the only thing that kept him from racing into the fray.",
    "It was the first day of term, and one of the rare days in Oxford when the weather was deceitfully marvellous; when its warmth promised more sunshine and joy than the relentless rain and sleet Hilary inevitably brought. Everything was clear blue skies and zesty hints of spring winds. Everyone would be inside today \u2013 faculty, graduate fellows, and students \u2013 and the tower lobby would be empty of clients, for this year Babel was closed for reshelving and renovations during the first week of the term. No civilians would be caught in the crossfire.",
    "They could not simply stroll up to the front door and go in. Their faces were plastered on newspapers all over London; certainly some of the scholars knew, even if the whole thing had been covered up in Oxford. The front door was still manned with half a dozen police. And by now, certainly, Professor Playfair had destroyed the blood vials that marked their belonging.",
    "Still, they had three advantages at their disposal: Griffin\u2019s expl\u014ddere distraction, the invisibility bar, and the fact that the wards around the door were designed to keep materials in, not out. This latter fact was only a theory, but a strong one. As far as they knew, the wards had only ever activated upon exit, not upon entrance. Thieves had always got in fine, so far as someone held the door open; it was leaving that was trouble.*",
    "The air shattered. The bar was harmless, Robin knew in theory, but still its noise was dreadful, was the sound of cities breaking, pyramids collapsing. He felt an instinct to scarper, to find safety, and though he knew it was only the silver manifesting on his mind, he had to overcome every impulse not to run in the other direction.",
    "As expected, the police had gone across the green; the door was swinging shut behind a handful of scholars. Robin and Victoire dashed up the pavement, around the seal, and pushed their way in behind them. Robin held his breath as they stepped over the threshold, but no sirens went off; no traps were sprung. They were in; they were safe.",
    "The lobby felt more crowded than usual. Had their message been seen, then? Had some of these people come to answer their call? He had no way of knowing who was with Hermes and who wasn\u2019t; everyone who met his gaze gave him the same disinterested, polite nod before moving on with their business. It all felt so absurdly normal. Did no one here know the world had broken?",
    "Across the rotunda Professor Playfair leaned against the second-floor balcony, chatting with Professor Chakravarti. Professor Chakravarti must have made a joke, for Professor Playfair laughed, shook his head, and looked out over the lobby. He met Robin\u2019s gaze. His eyes bulged.",
    "The bustling tower paid him no heed. Victoire climbed up next to him, wielding the ceremonial bell Professor Playfair used to announce exam results. She raised it over her head and gave it three furious shakes. The tower fell silent.",
    "\u2018Thank you,\u2019 said Robin. \u2018Ah. So. I\u2019ve got to say something.\u2019 His mind promptly went blank at the sight of so many staring faces. For several seconds he merely blinked, mute and startled, until at last the words came back to his tongue. He took a deep breath. \u2018We\u2019re shutting down the tower.\u2019",
    "\u2018There\u2019s a war going on,\u2019 Robin blurted. He winced as the words left his mouth; they were so clumsy, unpersuasive. He\u2019d had a speech prepared, but suddenly he could remember only the highlights, and those sounded ridiculous even as he spoke them aloud. Across the lobby and along the balconies of the floors above, he saw alternating expressions of scepticism, amusement, and annoyance. Even Professor Playfair, now panting at the base of the stairs, looked more baffled than agitated. Robin felt dizzy. He wanted to vomit.",
    "Griffin would have known how to compel them. Griffin was the storyteller, the true revolutionary; he could paint the necessary picture of imperial expansion, complicity, guilt, and responsibility with a handful of gutting phrases. But Griffin wasn\u2019t here, and the best Robin could do was to channel his dead brother\u2019s spirit.",
    "\u2018Parliament is debating military action on Canton.\u2019 He forced his voice to grow, to take up more space in the room than he ever had. \u2018There is no just pretext, apart from the greed of the trading companies. They\u2019re planning to force opium on the Chinese at gunpoint, and causing a diplomatic fiasco during my cohort\u2019s voyage was the excuse to do it.\u2019",
    "\u2018The British Empire does nothing without our help,\u2019 said Robin. \u2018We write the bars that power their guns, their ships. We polish the knives of domination. We draw up their treaties. If we withdraw our help, then Parliament can\u2019t move on China\u2014\u2019",
    "\u2018It\u2019s our problem because it\u2019s our professors who are behind it,\u2019 Victoire cut in. Her voice was shaky, but still louder, more sure than Robin\u2019s. \u2018They\u2019re running out of silver, this whole country\u2019s running a deficit, and some of our faculty think the way to fix it is by injecting opium into a foreign market. They\u2019ll do anything to push this through; they\u2019re murdering people who\u2019ve been trying to leak it. They killed Anthony Ribben\u2014\u2019",
    "\u2018No, he didn\u2019t,\u2019 said Victoire. \u2018He\u2019s been in hiding, working to stop the Empire from doing exactly this. They shot him last week. And Vimal Srinivasan, Ilse Dejima, and Cathy O\u2019Nell \u2013 go up to Jericho, go to the old building behind the forest past the bridge and you\u2019ll see the rubble, the bodies . . .\u2019",
    "\u2018They\u2019re insane,\u2019 snapped Professor Playfair. He\u2019d regained his composure, like an actor who\u2019d remembered his lines. He pointed a dramatic, accusing finger at the two of them. \u2018They\u2019re insane, they\u2019re working with a band of rioting thieves, they ought to be in prison\u2014\u2019",
    "But this seemed even more difficult for the room to swallow than Robin\u2019s story. Professor Playfair\u2019s booming voice, usually so engaging, had the contrary effect of making this seem like mere theatrics. No one else had a clue what the three of them were talking about; from the outside, it seemed as though they were all putting on a show.",
    "\u2018We have papers,\u2019 Robin said. It crossed his mind, then, that those papers were now certainly destroyed or confiscated, but still, as rhetoric, it worked. \u2018We have quotes, proof \u2013 it\u2019s all there. He\u2019s been planning this for years. Playfair\u2019s in on it, ask him\u2014\u2019",
    "\u2018But madness is incoherent.\u2019 Professor Craft frowned, glancing back and forth between the two of them. \u2018And lies are self-serving. This story \u2013 it benefits no one, certainly not these two,\u2019 she said, pointing at Robin and Victoire, \u2018and it is coherent.\u2019",
    "\u2018Professor.\u2019 Robin appealed directly to Professor Craft. \u2018Professor, please \u2013 he wants a war, he\u2019s been planning it for years. Go and look in his office. In Professor Lovell\u2019s office. Go through their papers. It\u2019s all there.\u2019",
    "\u2018No,\u2019 Professor Craft murmured. Her brows furrowed. Her eyes flickered across Robin and Victoire, and she seemed to register something \u2013 their hollow exhaustion, perhaps, the sag of their shoulders, or the grief seeping through their bones. \u2018No, I believe you . . .\u2019 She turned. \u2018Jerome? Did you know?\u2019",
    "Professor Playfair paused a moment, as if deliberating whether it was worth trying to keep up the pretence. Then he huffed. \u2018Don\u2019t act so shocked. You know what runs this tower. You knew the balance of power had to shift, you knew we had to do something about the deficit\u2014\u2019",
    "\u2018Don\u2019t pretend this is where you\u2019ll draw the line,\u2019 he said. \u2018You were just fine with everything else \u2013 it\u2019s not as if China has much to offer the world apart from its consumers. Why wouldn\u2019t we\u2014\u2019 He stopped. He seemed to have realized his mistake, that he\u2019d just validated their story.",
    "\u2018We use the languages of other countries to enrich this one.\u2019 Robin gazed around the tower as he spoke. He was not trying to convince Professor Playfair, he reminded himself; he had to appeal to the room. \u2018We take so much knowledge that isn\u2019t ours. The least we can do is stop this from happening. It\u2019s the only ethical thing.\u2019",
    "Yes, he was on solid footing now; here was a question to which he knew the answer. He lifted his chin, tried to inject his voice with all the authority of Griffin and Anthony. \u2018We shut down the tower. From this day forward, no clients enter the lobby. No one creates, sells, or maintains silver bars. We deny Britain all translation services until they capitulate \u2013 and they will capitulate, because they need us. They need us more than anything. That\u2019s how we win.\u2019 He paused. The room was silent.",
    "The student didn\u2019t move. He was a second year \u2013 Ibrahim, Robin recalled, an Arabic scholar from Egypt. He seemed incredibly young, a baby-faced boy; were second years always that young? Ibrahim glanced to Robin and Victoire, then back at Professor Playfair, frowning. \u2018But, sir . . .\u2019",
    "\u2018Don\u2019t,\u2019 Professor Craft told him, just as a pair of third years broke suddenly for the exit. One shoved Ibrahim against a shelf. Robin hurled a silver bar at the door. \u2018Expl\u014ddere, explode.\u2019 A great, horrible noise filled the lobby; this time a screeching howl. The third years scrambled away from the door like frightened rabbits.",
    "\u2018I killed Richard Lovell with this.\u2019 He couldn\u2019t believe these words were coming out of his mouth. This was not him speaking; this was the ghost of Griffin, the braver, madder brother, reaching through the underworld to pull his strings. \u2018If anyone takes a step towards me, and if anyone tries to call for help, I\u2019ll destroy them.\u2019",
    "That worried him. This had all been too easy. He\u2019d been sure he would face more resistance, but the room seemed utterly subdued. Even the professors did not move; indeed, Professors Leblanc and De Vreese huddled together under a table, as if bracing for cannon fire. He could tell them to dance a jig, to rip the pages out of their books one by one, and they would obey.",
    "He couldn\u2019t remember why the thought of acting had scared him so before. Griffin was right \u2013 the obstacle was not the struggle, but the failure to imagine it was possible at all, the compulsion to cling to the safe, the survivable status quo. But the whole world was off its hinges now. Every door was wide open. They\u2019d moved past the realm of ideas now, into the realm of action, and this was something Oxford students were wholly unprepared for.",
    "What happened next was not dignified, would never be shelved next to great epics of valour and bravery. For Oxford\u2019s scholars were sheltered and coddled, armchair theorists who wrote of blood-stained battlefields with smooth and delicate hands. The seizure of Babel was a clumsy, silly clash of the abstract and the material. The fellows approached the table, reaching with hesitant arms. Robin kicked them away. And it felt like kicking at children, for they were too fearful to be vicious, and they weren\u2019t nearly desperate or angry enough to really hurt him.",
    "They seemed unsure of what they even wanted to do \u2013 pull him down, grab his legs, or simply graze his ankles \u2013 and so his retaliatory blows were, similarly, perfunctory. They were playing at a fight, all of them, amateur actors given a stage direction: struggle..",
    "One of the scholars had climbed up onto the table behind her. She spun around. The scholar hesitated a moment, looked her up and down, then threw a punch. But he hit like he only knew about the action in theory, like he only knew of its component parts \u2013 plant feet, draw arm back, extend fist. He\u2019d misjudged his distance \u2013 the effect was nothing more than a light pat on Victoire\u2019s shoulder. She struck out with her left foot. He doubled over his shins, whining.",
    "\u2018Go ahead,\u2019 Robin breathed. He had no idea where this ridiculous fount of courage came from, but he felt not a shred of fear. The gun, somehow, seemed more abstract than real, the bullet wholly incapable of touching him. \u2018Go ahead, I dare you.\u2019",
    "He was gambling on Professor Playfair\u2019s cowardice, on the fact that he might wield a gun, but he wouldn\u2019t pull the trigger. Professor Playfair, like every other Babel scholar, hated getting his hands dirty. He designed lethal traps \u2013 he never wielded the blades himself. And he didn\u2019t know how much will, or panic, it took to really kill a man.",
    "Professor Playfair reeled backwards, scarlet exploding across his middle. Screams erupted around the tower. Robin glanced back over his shoulder. And Victoire lowered one of Griffin\u2019s revolvers, smoke tendrils curling up around her face, her eyes enormous.",
    "Professor De Vreese dashed suddenly across the hall. He was going for Professor Playfair\u2019s gun. Robin jumped down off the table, but he was too far away \u2013 but then Professor Chakravarti threw himself at Professor De Vreese\u2019s side. They hit the floor with a whumph and began to wrestle \u2013 a clumsy, inelegant sight, two paunchy, middle-aged professors rolling around on the ground, their gowns flapping over their waists. Robin watched, astonished, as Professor Chakravarti wrenched the gun out of Professor De Vreese\u2019s grasp and pinned him down in a messy hold.",
    "Robin pointed the gun at the chandelier and pulled the trigger. The chandelier exploded; glass shards sprinkled across the lobby. It was as if he\u2019d shot into the crowd; everyone shrieked and cringed. Professor De Vreese turned and ran, but his ankle caught on a desk leg and he toppled backwards onto his bum. Robin reset the chamber, just as Griffin had shown him, and then pointed the gun at Professor De Vreese once again.",
    "No one moved. No one spoke. They all shrank back, terrified. Some were crying; some had their hands clamped over their mouths, as if that were the only way to contain their screams. And all were watching him, waiting for him to dictate what came next.",
    "He glanced over his shoulder at Victoire. She looked as bewildered as she felt; her gun hung limp at her side. Deep down, neither of them had expected to actually get this far. Their visions of today had involved chaos: a violent and devastating last stand; a fracas that, in all likelihood, ended in death. They\u2019d been prepared for sacrifice; they had not been prepared to win.",
    "\u2018Nothing leaves Babel,\u2019 Robin declared. \u2018We put a lockdown on the silver-working tools. We stop routine maintenance on the city. We wait for the machine to grind to a halt, and hope they capitulate before we do.\u2019 He didn\u2019t know where these words were coming from, but they sounded good. \u2018This country can\u2019t last a month without us. We strike until they bend.\u2019",
    "And that, the key to Griffin\u2019s theory of violence, was why they might win. They\u2019d finally worked it out. It was why Griffin and Anthony had been so confident in their struggle, why they were convinced the colonies could take on the Empire. Empire needed extraction. Violence shocked the system, because the system could not cannibalize itself and survive. The hands of the Empire were tied, because it could not raze that from which it profited. And like those sugar fields, like those markets, like those bodies of unwilling labour, Babel was an asset.",
    "Britain needed Chinese, needed Arabic and Sanskrit and all the languages of colonized territories to function. Britain could not hurt Babel without hurting itself. And so Babel alone, an asset denied, could grind the Empire to a halt..",
    "\u2018I hope you\u2019ll join us,\u2019 said Robin. \u2018But if you don\u2019t, you can leave the tower. Order the police away first, and then you can file out one by one. No one retrieves anything from the tower \u2013 you walk out with what\u2019s on your person.\u2019* He paused. \u2018And I\u2019m sure you understand we\u2019ll have to destroy your blood vials if you go.\u2019",
    "As soon as he finished, a shuffle of bodies moved towards the door. Robin\u2019s heart sank as he counted the numbers. Dozens were leaving \u2013 all of the Classicists, all of the Europeanists, and nearly all of the faculty. Professor Playfair was carried out still moaning, slung ignominiously between Professor De Vreese and Professor Harding.",
    "Only six scholars remained: Professor Chakravarti, Professor Craft, two undergraduates \u2013 Ibrahim and a tiny girl named Juliana \u2013 and two graduate fellows named Yusuf and Meghana, who worked in Legal and Literature respectively. Faces of colour, faces from the colonies, except for Professor Craft.",
    "But this could work. They could sacrifice their hold on the talent if they retained control of the tower. Babel contained the greatest concentration of silver-working resources in the country: Grammaticas, engraving pens, match-pair ledgers, and reference materials. And more than that, the silver.",
    "Professor Playfair and the others might establish a secondary translation centre elsewhere, but even if they could reconstruct everything they needed to maintain the country\u2019s silver-work from memory, it would take them weeks, perhaps months, to acquire materials on the scale necessary to replicate the functions of the tower. By then the vote would have already happened. By then, if all went to plan, the country would have already been brought to its knees..",
    "At noon Robin and Victoire climbed up to the north balcony on the eighth floor. The balcony was largely decorative, designed for scholars who\u2019d never internalized the concept of needing fresh air. No one ever stepped out there, and the door was nearly rusted shut. Robin pushed, leaning hard against the frame. When it swung suddenly open, he lurched out and found himself leaning over the ledge for one brief, terrifying moment before he regained his balance.",
    "Oxford looked so tiny beneath him. A doll\u2019s house, a twee approximation of the real world for boys who would never have to truly engage with it. He wondered if this was how men like Jardine and Matheson saw the world \u2013 minuscule, manipulable. If people and places moved around the lines they drew. If cities shattered when they stomped.",
    "Below, the stone steps at the front of the tower were alight with flames. The blood vials of all but the eight scholars who\u2019d remained within the tower had been smashed against the bricks, doused with oil poured from unused lamps, and set aflame. This was not strictly necessary; all that mattered was that the vials were removed from the tower \u2013 but Robin and Victoire had insisted on ceremony. They had learned from Professor Playfair the importance of performance, and this macabre display was a statement, a warning. The castle was stormed, the magician thrown out.",
    "\u2018Ready?\u2019 Victoire placed a stack of papers on the ledge. Babel did not possess its own printing press, so they\u2019d spent the morning laboriously copying out each of those hundred pamphlets. The declaration borrowed both from Anthony\u2019s coalition-building rhetoric and Griffin\u2019s philosophy of violence. Robin and Victoire had joined their voices \u2013 one an eloquent urge to link arms in a fight for justice, the other an uncompromising threat to those who opposed them \u2013 into a clear, succinct announcement of their intentions.",
    "We, the students of the Royal Institute of Translation, demand Britain cease consideration of an unlawful war against China. Given this government\u2019s determination to initiate hostilities and its brutal suppression of those working to expose its motives, we have no other option to make our voices heard than to cease all translation and silver-working services by the Institute, until such time as our demands are met. We henceforth declare our strike.",
    "Such an interesting word, Robin thought, strike.* It brought to mind hammers against spikes, bodies throwing themselves against an immovable force. It contained in itself the paradox of the concept; that through nonaction, and nonviolence, one might prove the devastating consequences of refusing to accommodate those one relied upon.",
    "Below them, Oxfordians were going about their merry way. No one glanced up; no one saw the two students leaning over the tallest point in the city. The exiled translators were nowhere in sight; if Playfair had sought the police, they had not yet chosen to act. The city remained serene, clueless as to what was coming.",
    "Oxford, we ask you to stand with us. The strike will cause great hardships for the city in days to come. We ask you to direct your ire to the government that has made such a strike our only recourse. We ask you to stand on the side of justice and fairness.",
    "From there the pamphlets articulated the clear dangers of an influx of silver to the British economy, not only for China and the colonies, but for the working class of England. Robin did not expect anyone to read that far. He did not expect the city to support their strike; to the contrary, once the silver-work began breaking down, he expected they would hate them.",
    "They had chosen the unlikeliest of places for a revolution. Oxford was not the centre of activity, it was a refuge, decades behind the rest of England in every realm but the academic. The university was designed to be a bastion of antiquity, where scholars could fancy themselves in any of the past five centuries, where scandals and turmoil were so scarce that it made the University College newsletter if a red-breast began singing near the end of an exhaustingly long sermon at Christ Church.",
    "But though Oxford was not the seat of power, it produced the occupants thereof. Its alumni ran the Empire. Someone, perhaps this moment, was rushing to Oxford Station with news of the occupation. Someone would recognize its significance, would see it was not a petty students\u2019 game but a crisis of national importance. Someone would get this in front of the Cabinet and the House of Lords. Then Parliament would choose what happened next.",
    "She pushed the stack off the ledge. The pamphlets took flight. The wind carried them soaring across the city; over spires and turrets down onto streets, yards, and gardens; flying down chimneys, darting through grates, slipping into open windows. They accosted everyone they came across, clinging to coats, flapping in faces, sticking persistently to satchels and briefcases. Most would bat them aside, irritated. But a few would pick them up, would read the strikers\u2019 manifesto, would slowly register what this meant for Oxford, for London, and for the Empire.",
    "\u2018It wasn\u2019t the same.\u2019 He tried to find words that would comfort, that would make it out to be anything other than it was. \u2018It was self-defence. And he might still survive, it might \u2013 I mean, it won\u2019t be\u2014\u2019",
    "The mood that afternoon was one of nervous apprehension. Like children who had kicked over an ants\u2019 nest, they now watched fearfully to see how awful the ramifications would be. Hours had passed. Surely the escaped professors had liaised with city policy-makers by now. Surely London had read those pamphlets by now. What form would the backlash take? They had all spent years trusting in the impenetrability of the tower; its wards, until now, had shielded them from everything. Still, it felt as if they were counting down the minutes to a vicious retaliation.",
    "\u2018They have to send in the constables,\u2019 said Professor Craft. \u2018Even if they can\u2019t get in. There will be some attempted arrest, surely. If not for the strike, then for\u2014\u2019 She glanced at Victoire, blinked, and trailed off.",
    "\u2018Actually, we are,\u2019 said Yusuf, who worked in Legal. \u2018It\u2019s in the founding documents. Babel alums and students comprise the Translators\u2019 Guild by virtue of their institutional affiliation, so by holding a strike we are in violation of the law, if you want to get technical about it.\u2019",
    "But their good humour faded quickly. The association between their strike and the trade unions left a bad taste in all of their mouths, for the workers\u2019 agitations of the 1830s \u2013 brought about directly as the result of the silver industrial revolution \u2013 had met with resounding failure. The Luddites had ended up either dead or exiled to Australia. The Lancashire spinners were forced back to work to avoid starvation within a year.",
    "The Swing Rioters, by smashing threshing machines and setting barns on fire, had secured a temporary improvement in wages and working conditions, but these were promptly reneged upon; more than a dozen rioters were hanged, and hundreds were sent to penal colonies in Australia..",
    "Strikers in this country never won broad public support, for the public merely wanted all the conveniences of modern life without the guilt of knowing how those conveniences were procured. And why should the translators succeed where other strikers \u2013 white strikers, no less \u2013 had failed?",
    "There was at least one reason to hope. They were running on momentum. The social forces that had prompted the Luddites to smash machines had not disappeared. They had only grown worse. Silver-powered looms and spinning machines were getting cheaper and more ubiquitous, enriching none but factory owners and financiers. Each year they put more men out of work, left more families destitute, and maimed and killed more children in machines that operated more quickly than the human eye could track.",
    "And their strike, Robin was convinced, was different. Their impact was larger, harder to patch over. There were no alternatives to Babel, no scabs. No one else could do what they did. Britain could not function without them. If Parliament did not believe it, then they would soon learn.",
    "Still no policemen had appeared by evening. This lack of response baffled them. But soon logistical problems \u2013 namely, supplies and accommodation \u2013 became the more pressing matters at hand. It was clear now that they were going to be in the tower for quite some time, with no clear end date to their strike. At some point they were going to run out of food.",
    "There was a tiny, rarely used kitchen in the basement, where servants had once lived before the Institute stopped housing its janitorial staff for free. Occasionally scholars ducked downstairs for a snack when working late. A foray into the cabinets produced a decent amount of nonperishables \u2013 nuts, preserves, indestructible tea biscuits, and dry oats for porridge. It wasn\u2019t much, but they wouldn\u2019t starve overnight. And they found many, many bottles of wine, left over from years of faculty functions and garden parties.",
    "Nor could they simply poke their heads outside and put in an order to the grocer\u2019s. They had no friends in town, no one who could act as their liaison with the outer world. Professor Craft had a brother in Reading, but there was no way of getting a letter to him, and nor was there a safe way for him to deliver foodstuffs up to the tower.",
    "And Professor Chakravarti, it turned out, had a very limited relationship with Hermes \u2013 he\u2019d been recruited only after his promotion to junior faculty, after his ties to upper faculty rendered him too risky for deeper involvement \u2013 and he knew Hermes only through anonymous letters and drop points. No one else had responded to their beacon. As far as they knew, they were the only ones left..",
    "Very soon a number of other problems arose. Babel was blessed with running water and indoor lavatories, but there was no place to shower. No one had an extra change of clothes, and there were of course no laundering facilities \u2013 all of them had their washing done by invisible scouts. Apart from a single cot on the eighth floor, which was used as an unofficial nap space by the graduate fellows, there were no beds, pillows, linens, or anything that might make for comfortable bedding at night except for their own coats.",
    "\u2018Think of it like this,\u2019 Professor Chakravarti said in a valiant attempt to lift their mood. \u2018Who doesn\u2019t dream of living in a library? Is there not a certain romance to our situation? Who among us would balk at a completely unhindered life of the mind?\u2019",
    "At half past ten, Meghana ran up from the lobby and breathlessly announced that London was sending a telegram. They crowded around the machine, watching nervously as Professor Chakravarti took down the message and transcribed it. He blinked at it for a moment, then said, \u2018They\u2019ve more or less told us to shove it.\u2019",
    "So Parliament had declined to meet their demands \u2013 or indeed to take them seriously at all. Perhaps it was silly to hope the strike would produce a response so soon, before the lack of silver had taken effect, but they had hoped at least that Parliament would acknowledge the threat. Did the MPs think this whole thing would blow over on its own? Were they trying to prevent a general panic? Was this why not a single policeman had knocked on the door, why the green outside was as serene and empty as it had ever been?",
    "No one had an answer. They couldn\u2019t help feeling somewhat petulant, like toddlers who\u2019d thrown tantrums but had not been rewarded for their efforts. All that trouble for such a curt response \u2013 it all seemed so pathetic.",
    "They lingered around the telegraph machine for a few more moments, hoping it might spring to life with better news \u2013 that Parliament was greatly concerned, that they\u2019d called a midnight debate, that crowds of protestors had flooded Trafalgar Square to demand the war be called off. But the needle remained still. One by one they slunk back upstairs, hungry and dispirited.",
    "For the rest of the evening, Robin would occasionally step out onto the rooftop to peer over the city, scanning for any indication of change or unrest. But Oxford remained tranquil, undisturbed. Their pamphlets lay trodden in the street, stuck in grates, flapping pointlessly in the gentle night breeze. No one had even bothered to clean them up.",
    "They had little to say to one another that night as they made their beds among the stacks, huddling under coats and spare gowns. The convivial atmosphere of that afternoon had vanished. They were all suffering the same unspoken, private fear, a creeping dread that this strike might do nothing but damn themselves, and that their cries would go unheard into the unforgiving dark.",
    "None of them had anticipated this. They only worked out afterwards what had happened, after they\u2019d checked the work order ledgers and realized what they could have done to prevent it. Magdalen Tower, the second-tallest building in Oxford, had relied since the eighteenth century on silver-facilitated engineering tricks to support its weight after centuries of soil erosion had eaten at its foundations. Babel scholars did routine maintenance on its supports every six months, once in January and once again in June.",
    "In the hours that followed the disaster, they would learn that it was Professor Playfair who had overseen these biannual reinforcements for the past fifteen years, and whose notes on such procedures were locked in his office, inaccessible to the exiled Babel faculty, who had not even remembered Magdalen Tower\u2019s upcoming appointment.",
    "They would find in their letterbox a flurry of messages from the panicked members of the city council who had expected Professor Playfair the previous evening, and who discovered only the next day that he was laid up in hospital, pumped full of laudanum and unconscious. They would learn that one council member had passed the early hours of the morning banging frantically at Babel\u2019s door; only none of them heard or saw him, for the wards kept out all riffraff who might disrupt the scholars inside..",
    "Meanwhile, the clock had run out on Magdalen Tower. At nine on the dot, a rumbling began at its base and spread through the entire city. At Babel, their teacups began clattering at breakfast. They thought they were experiencing an earthquake, until they rushed to the windows and saw that nothing was noticeably shaking except a single building in the distance.",
    "If they were, at least they had ample time to get out. The building had been shaking for a good fifteen minutes now. This was their ethical defence; they did not let themselves consider the alternatives.",
    "At twenty past nine, all ten of the tower\u2019s bells began to ring at once, without rhythm or harmony. They seemed to grow louder, building up to a terrible level; they reached a crescendo with an urgency that made Robin himself want to scream.",
    "Then the tower collapsed, as simply and cleanly as a sandcastle kicked at the base. It took less than ten seconds for the building to fall, but nearly a minute for the rumbling to settle. Then, where Magdalen Tower had once stood was a great mound of brick, dust, and stone. And it was somehow lovely, unnervingly lovely because it was so awful, because it violated the rules of how things were supposed to move. That the city\u2019s horizon could, in an instant, be changed this dramatically was both breathtaking and awesome.",
    "\u2018Magdalen Tower was an accident,\u2019 said Professor Craft. \u2018But Professor Chakravarti is right. It\u2019ll put the rest of them on guard, covering for the effects that we\u2019ve halted. It\u2019s a race against time now \u2013 they\u2019ll have regrouped somewhere else, surely, and they\u2019ll be trying to construct a new translation centre as we speak\u2014\u2019",
    "\u2018That will hurt, in time, but in the short term they will manage to plug the worst of the gaps,\u2019 said Professor Craft. \u2018They\u2019ll wait us out \u2013 we have porridge for a week at most, Swift, and what then? We starve?\u2019",
    "\u2018Up on the eighth floor,\u2019 said Robin. \u2018Let\u2019s go, I\u2019ll show you. It\u2019s how the distant bars are maintained, the ones that aren\u2019t made for endurance. The centre to the periphery. If we remove the centre, then surely they\u2019ll begin to fail, won\u2019t they?\u2019",
    "\u2018Then we\u2019ll remove just a few at once.\u2019 Robin stood up. His mind was made up. He did not want to debate this further, and he could see none of them did either; they were too anxious, and too afraid. They only wanted someone to tell them what to do. \u2018One by one, until they get the general idea. Would you like to pick which ones?\u2019",
    "The professors declined. Robin suspected it was too much for them to deconstruct the resonance rods by themselves, for they knew too well the consequences of what they did. They needed to preserve the illusion of innocence, or at least of ignorance. But they expressed no further opposition, and so that evening Robin and Victoire went together up to the eighth floor.",
    "\u2018Perhaps two dozen to start,\u2019 said Robin. There must have been hundreds of rods in the room. He had the impulse to kick them all down, to just grab one and use it to bat down the others. \u2018Don\u2019t we want to be dramatic?\u2019",
    "\u2018I only mean, we need to get their attention.\u2019 Robin pressed a fist into a palm. \u2018I want a spectacle. I want Armageddon. I want them to think that a dozen Magdalen Towers will fall every day until they listen to us.\u2019",
    "\u2018Two dozen to start.\u2019 Robin reached down and pulled the nearest resonance rod from its fixture. It slid out with surprising ease. He\u2019d expected some resistance, some noise or transformation symbolizing the break. \u2018Is it that simple?\u2019",
    "The rapidity of its deterioration was stunning. The next day, all the bell-tower clocks stopped running, all frozen at precisely 6.37 in the morning. Later that afternoon, a great stink wafted over the city. It turned out silver had been used to facilitate the flow of sewage, which was now stuck in place, an unmoving mass of sludge. That evening, Oxford went dark. First one lamp-post started flickering, then another, and then another, until all of the lights on High Street went out.",
    "\u2018This is how Babel was designed to work,\u2019 said Professor Chakravarti. \u2018We made the city as reliant on the Institute as possible. We designed bars to last for only several weeks instead of months, because maintenance appointments bring in money. This is the cost of inflating prices and artificially creating demand. It all works beautifully, until it doesn\u2019t.\u2019",
    "By the morning of the third day, transportation began breaking down. Most of the carts in England used a variety of match-pairs that played with the concept of speed. The word speed in modern English was specific to a sense of rapidity, but as a number of common phrases \u2013 Godspeed, good speed to you \u2013 proved, the root meaning, deriving with the Latin sp\u0113s, meaning \u2018to hope\u2019, was associated with good fortune and success, with the broader sense of seeking one\u2019s destination, of crossing great distances to reach one\u2019s goal.",
    "But drivers had become too accustomed to the bars, and thus did not correct for when they failed. Accidents multiplied. Oxford\u2019s roads became blocked with overturned wagons and cabs that had taken corners too tightly. Up in the Cotswolds a small family of eight tumbled straight into a ravine because the driver had got used to sitting back and letting the horses take over during tricky turns.",
    "The postal system, too, ground to a halt. For years, Royal Mail couriers with particularly heavy loads had been using bars engraved with the French-English match-pair parcelle-parcel. Both French and English had once used parcel to refer to pieces of land that made up an estate, but when it evolved to imply an item of business in both, it retained its connotation of small fragmentariness in French, whereas in English it simply meant a package. Fixing this bar to the postal carriage made the parcels seem a fraction of their true weight.",
    "But it was impossible to tell from within the tower. They had no way to gauge public opinion in either Oxford or London, except through the papers which, hilariously, were still delivered to the front door every morning. This was how they learned about the Cotswold family tragedy, the traffic accidents, and the countrywide courier slowdown. But the London papers made hardly any mention of the war on China or the strike, save for a brief announcement about some \u2018internal disturbances\u2019 at the \u2018prestigious Royal Institute of Translation\u2019.",
    "But how long did Parliament think it could keep things quiet? On the fifth morning, they were woken by a horribly discordant noise. It took some rooting through the ledgers to find out what was going on. Great Tom of Christ Church, the loudest bell in Oxford, had always sung a slightly imperfect B-flat note. But whatever silver-work regulated its sound had stopped working, and Great Tom now blared a devastating, eerie groan. By that afternoon, it was joined by the bells at St Martin\u2019s, St Mary\u2019s, and Osney Abbey, an ongoing, miserable, groaning chorus.",
    "The bells were a funeral dirge to an illusion. The city of dreaming spires was no longer. Oxford\u2019s degradation was visible \u2013 one could see it crumbling by the hour like a rotting gingerbread house. What became clear was how deeply Oxford relied on silver, how without the constant labour of its translation corps, of the talent it attracted from abroad, it immediately fell apart. It revealed more than the power of translation.",
    "It revealed the sheer dependence of the British, who, astonishingly, could not manage to do basic things like bake bread or get safely from one place to another without words stolen from other countries..",
    "\u2018How far are they going to let this go?\u2019 was the question they kept asking inside the tower. For they were all amazed, and somewhat horrified, that the city had still not acknowledged the real reason behind this strike; that Parliament had still not taken action.",
    "Privately, Robin did not want this to end. He would never confess it to the others, but deep down, where the ghosts of Griffin and Ramy resided, he did not want a speedy resolution, a nominal settlement that only papered over decades of exploitation.",
    "He wanted to see how far he could take this. He wanted to see Oxford broken down to its foundations, wanted its fat, golden opulence to slough away; for its pale, elegant bricks to crumble to pieces; for its turrets to smash against cobblestones; for its bookshelves to collapse like dominoes. He wanted the whole place dismantled so thoroughly that it would be as if it had never been built.",
    "All those buildings assembled by slaves, paid for by slaves, and stuffed with artefacts stolen from conquered lands, those buildings which had no right to exist, whose ongoing existence demanded continuous extraction and violence \u2013 destroyed, undone..",
    "They gathered round a fourth-floor window and peered down below. Many of the crowd were Oxford students \u2013 black-robed young men marching in defence of their town; scowling, chests puffed out. Robin recognized Vincy Woolcombe by his shock of red hair, and then Elton Pendennis, waving a torch above his head, shouting at the men behind him as if leading troops onto a battlefield. But there were women too, and children, and barkeeps and shopkeepers and farmers: a rare alliance of town and gown.",
    "Indeed, it seemed that the agitators had not thought through how they would actually storm the tower. They were not even shouting in unison. Most just milled around the green, confused, glancing around as if waiting for someone else to give orders. This was not the angry mob of unemployed workers that had threatened Babel\u2019s scholars over the past year; these were schoolboys and townspeople for whom violence was a wholly unfamiliar means of getting what they wanted.",
    "Were they going to burn them alive? Stupid, that would be so stupid \u2013 surely they understood the whole point was that Babel could not be lost, for Babel and the knowledge contained within it was precisely what they were fighting to reacquire. But perhaps rationality had fled. Perhaps there was only the mob, fuelled by the sheer fury that something they thought was theirs had been taken from them.",
    "Robin put the bar back into his pocket, took a deep breath, and wondered at the hammering in his veins. He wanted a fight. He wanted to jump down there and bloody their faces with his fists. Wanted them to know exactly what he was, which was their worst nightmare \u2013 uncivilized, brutal, violent.",
    "But it was over before it started. Like Professor Playfair, Pendennis and his sort were not soldiers. They liked to threaten and bluster. They liked to pretend the world obeyed their every whim. But at the end of the day, they were not meant for material struggle. They hadn\u2019t the faintest clue how much effort it might take to bring down a tower, and Babel was the most fortified tower on earth.",
    "Pendennis lowered his torch and set light to the kindling. The crowd cheered as the flames licked up the walls. But the fire failed to take. The flames jumped hungrily, reaching with orange tendrils as if seeking a foothold, but pointlessly fell back again. Several students ran up to the tower walls in some badly thought-out attempt to scale them, but they scarcely touched the bricks before some unseen force hurled them back against the green.",
    "He leaned out of the window, observed the fracas for a moment, and then hurled the bar at the centre of the mob. In seconds, the crowd began to dispel. Robin couldn\u2019t quite tell what was going on, but there seemed to be an argument on the ground, and the agitators wore looks of alternating irritation and confusion as they milled around like ducks circling each other on a pond. Then, one by one, they drifted away from the tower; to home, to dinner, to waiting wives and husbands and children.",
    "A small number of students lingered on for a little while. Elton Pendennis was still pontificating on the green, waving his torch above his head, yelling curses that they could not hear through the wards. But the tower, clearly, was never going to catch fire. The kindling burned pointlessly against the stone, and then spluttered out. The protestors\u2019 voices grew hoarse with shouting; their cries faltered, and then finally died out completely. By sunset, the last of the rabble had straggled home.",
    "The translators did not have supper until nearly midnight; unseasoned gruel, peach preserves, and two tea biscuits each. After much begging, Professor Craft relented and permitted them to bring up several bottles of red wine from the cellar. \u2018Well,\u2019 she said, pouring out generous glasses with a shaky hand. \u2018Wasn\u2019t that exciting.\u2019",
    "They\u2019d never been in any real danger the day before; even Juliana, who\u2019d quietly cried herself to sleep, now laughed at the memory. But that prenatal riot was only the beginning. Oxford would continue to crumble, and the city would only hate them more. They had to prepare for next time.",
    "They threw themselves into the work. Suddenly the tower felt just as it did during exam season. They sat in rows on the eighth floor, heads hunched over their texts, and the only sounds in the room were pages flipping and the occasional exclamation when someone stumbled upon a promising nugget of etymology. This felt good. Here at last was something to do, something that kept them from dawdling nervously as they awaited news from the outside.",
    "Robin rooted through stacks of notes he\u2019d found in Professor Lovell\u2019s office, which contained many potential match-pairs prepared for the China campaign. One excited him very much: the Chinese character \u5229 (l\u00ec) could mean to sharpen one\u2019s weapon, though it also carried connotations of profit and advantage, and its logogram represented grain being cut with a knife. Knives sharpened with the \u5229-sharp match-pair had frightfully thin blades, and unerringly found their targets.",
    "They began living like defenders under siege. They consulted classical texts \u2013 military histories, field manuals, strategic treatises \u2013 for ideas on how to run the tower. They instituted strict mealtimes and rations; no nibbling of the biscuits at midnight, as Ibrahim and Juliana had been caught doing. They hauled the rest of the old astronomy telescopes out onto the rooftop so they could keep watch over the deteriorating city.",
    "A day passed like this, and then another. It finally sank in that they\u2019d passed the point of no return, that this was no temporary divergence; there would be no resumption of normal life. They emerged from here the victors, the harbingers of an unrecognizable Britain, or they left this tower dead.",
    "\u2018Everyone.\u2019 Victoire sounded dazed, as if she couldn\u2019t believe it herself. \u2018Anthony\u2019s pamphlets must have worked \u2013 I mean, the ones addressing the Radicals, the ones about labour, because look\u2014\u2019 She waved a telegram at him. \u2018Even the telegraph office. They say there\u2019ve been crowds around Parliament all day, demanding that they withdraw the war proposal\u2014\u2019",
    "\u2018All the strikers from a few years ago \u2013 the tailors, the shoemakers, the weavers. They\u2019re all striking again. And there\u2019s more \u2013 there are dock workers, factory employees, gasworks stokers \u2013 I mean, really, everyone. Look.\u2019 She shook the telegram. \u2018Look. It\u2019ll be in all the papers tomorrow.\u2019",
    "Was Anthony right? Had they forged the most unlikely of alliances? Theirs was not the first of the antisilver revolts of that decade, only the most dramatic. The Rebecca Riots in Wales, the Bull Ring Riots in Birmingham, and the Chartist uprisings in Sheffield and Bradford just earlier that year had all tried and failed to halt the silver industrial revolution. The papers had made them out to be isolated outbursts of discontent. But it was clear now that they were all connected, all caught in the same web of coercion and exploitation.",
    "What was happening to the Lancashire spinners had happened to Indian weavers first. Sweating, exhausted textile workers in silver-gilded British factories spun cotton picked by slaves in America. Everywhere the silver industrial revolution had wrought poverty, inequality, and suffering, while the only ones who benefited were those in power at the heart of the Empire. And the grand accomplishment of the imperial project was to take only a little from so many places; to fragment and distribute the suffering so that at no point did it ever become too much for the entire community to bear.",
    "And if the oppressed came together, if they rallied around a common cause \u2013 here, now, was one of the impossible pivot points Griffin had spoken of so often. Here was their chance to push history off its course.",
    "\u2018Hold on.\u2019 Robin raised his voice over the din. \u2018No \u2013 this threat, the Army \u2013 it all means it\u2019s working, don\u2019t you see? It means they\u2019re scared. On the first day they still thought they could order us around. But they\u2019ve felt the consequences now. They\u2019re terrified. Which means if we can just hold on for a bit, if we can just keep this up, we\u2019ll win.\u2019",
    "The next morning they awoke to find that a set of barricades had mysteriously sprung up around the tower overnight. Great, tottering obstructions blocked up every major street leading towards Babel \u2013 High Street, Broad Street, Cornmarket. Was this the Army\u2019s work? They wondered. But it all seemed too slapdash, too haphazard to be an Army operation.",
    "The barricades were made of everyday materials \u2013 upturned carts, sand-filled barrels, fallen streetlamps, iron grillwork ripped away from the fences round Oxford\u2019s parks, and the stone rubble that had been gathering at every street corner as evidence of the city\u2019s slow deterioration. And what benefit did the Army obtain by fencing in their own streets?.",
    "They descended to the lobby together. From the window they saw a tall, broad-shouldered, bearded man waiting on the steps. He didn\u2019t appear to be armed, nor particularly hostile, but his presence was baffling nonetheless.",
    "He\u2019d seen this man before, Robin realized. He wasn\u2019t carrying his sign, but he stood the same way he always had during the mill workers\u2019 protests: fists clenched, chin up, glaring determinedly at the tower as if he could topple it with his mind.",
    "But Robin was already pulling on his coat. \u2018No, he won\u2019t.\u2019 He had a suspicion of what was happening, and though he was afraid to hope just yet, his heart raced with excitement. \u2018I think he\u2019s here to help.\u2019",
    "\u2018It\u2019ll do a better job warding off troops than you think,\u2019 said Abel. \u2018It\u2019s not just about the walls \u2013 though they\u2019ll hold, you\u2019ll see. It\u2019s psychological. The barricades create the impression that there\u2019s a real resistance going on, while the Army currently thinks they\u2019ll be marching on the tower unopposed. And it emboldens our protestors \u2013 it creates a safe haven, a place to retreat.\u2019",
    "Robin and Victoire exchanged a glance. They both felt rather ashamed now of their disdain for the strikers over the past year. They\u2019d bought into Professor Lovell\u2019s claims, that the strikers were simply lazy, pathetic, and undeserving of basic economic dignities. But how different, really, were their causes?",
    "\u2018It was never about the silver,\u2019 said Abel. \u2018You realize that now, don\u2019t you? It was about the wage-cutting. The shoddy work. The women and children kept all day in hot airless rooms, the danger of untested machines the eye can\u2019t track. We were suffering. And we only wanted to make you see it.\u2019",
    "\u2018Anyhow.\u2019 Abel gestured at the barricades behind him. The movement was preciously awkward, like a suitor showing off his roses. \u2018We learned what you were up to, and thought we might come up and help. At least we can stop those buffoons from burning the tower down.\u2019",
    "And so the battle lines were drawn. That afternoon commenced the strangest collaboration Robin had ever witnessed. Men who weeks ago had been screaming obscenities at Babel students now sat in the lobby among them, talking over tactics of street warfare and barrier integrity. Professor Craft and a striker named Maurice Long stood with their heads bent over a map of Oxford, discussing ideal locations for more barriers to block off Army entry points.",
    "\u2018Barricades are the only good thing we ever imported from the French,\u2019 Maurice was saying.* \u2018Over the wide roads, we want low-level obstructions \u2013 paving stones, overturned trees, that sort of thing. It takes time to clear, and it keeps them from bringing in horses or heavy artillery. And here, if we cut off the narrower access points around the quadrangle, we can keep them restricted to High Street . . .\u2019*.",
    "Victoire and Ibrahim sat at a table with several other strikers, dutifully taking down notes on what sort of silver bars might best aid their defences. The word barrels came up quite a lot; Robin, eavesdropping, gathered they were planning to raid some wine cellars for structural reinforcements.*",
    "The scholars watched from the rooftop as red-coated troops rolled in a single column along High Street. The arrival of an armed platoon ought to have been a grand occasion, but it was hard to feel any real fear. The troops looked rather out of place among the townhouses and shops of the city centre, and the townspeople who turned out to cheer their arrival made them look more like a parade than a punitive military force. They marched slowly, making way for civilians crossing the street. It was all rather quaint and polite.",
    "They halted when they reached the barricades. The commander, a richly mustachioed fellow decked out in medals, dismounted from his horse and strode to the first upturned wagon. He seemed deeply confused by this. He glanced around at the watching townspeople, as if awaiting some explanation.",
    "The commander met Abel in the middle of the street. They exchanged words. Robin could not hear what they were saying, but the conversation seemed heated. It began in a civil manner, but then both men started gesticulating wildly; at several points he was afraid the commander was about to put Abel in handcuffs. At last they came to some agreement. Abel retreated behind the barricade, walking backwards as if making sure no one shot him in the back. The mustachioed commander returned to his battalion. Then, to Robin\u2019s amazement, the Army began to retreat.",
    "\u2018More than that,\u2019 said Abel. \u2018This is all going to play out in fits and starts. They\u2019ll give another warning. Then another. Then a third, strongly worded this time. They\u2019ll drag their feet for as long as they can. If they were planning to storm us, they would have done so right then and there.\u2019",
    "\u2018Those weren\u2019t riots over territory,\u2019 said Abel. \u2018Those were riots over policies. The rioters didn\u2019t need to hold their ground; when they were fired upon, they scattered. But we\u2019re embedded in the heart of a city. We\u2019ve staked our claim on the tower, and on Oxford itself. If any of those soldiers accidentally strikes a bystander, this spirals out of their control. They can\u2019t break the barricades without breaking the city. And that, I think, Parliament cannot afford.\u2019 He rose to leave. \u2018We\u2019ll keep them out. You keep writing your pamphlets.\u2019",
    "When it came down to it, the tower itself would provide much better protection than Abel Goodfellow\u2019s hotchpotch obstructions could. But the barricades had more than mere symbolic value. They covered an area large enough to allow crucial supply lines in and out of the tower. This meant the scholars now got fresh food and fresh water (dinner that night was a bounty of fluffy white rolls and roast chicken), and it meant they had a reliable source for information on what was going on beyond the tower walls.",
    "Despite all expectations, Abel\u2019s supporters grew in number over the following days. The workmen strikers were better at getting the message out than any of Robin\u2019s pamphlets. They spoke the same language, after all. The British could identify with Abel in a way they could not with foreign-born translators. Striking labourers from all over England came to join their cause. Young Oxford boys, bored with being cooped up at home and looking for something to do, turned up to the barricades simply because it seemed exciting. Women joined the ranks as well, out-of-work seamstresses and factory girls.",
    "What a sight, this influx of defenders to the tower. The barricades had the peculiar effect of building community. They were all comrades in arms behind those walls, no matter their origins, and the regular deliveries of foodstuffs to the tower came with handwritten messages of encouragement. Robin had expected only violence, not solidarity, and he wasn\u2019t sure what to do with this show of support. It defied what he had come to expect of the world. He was scared to let it make him hope.",
    "One morning he discovered Abel had left them a gift \u2013 a wagon deposited before the tower doors, piled high with mattresses, pillows, and homespun blankets. A scrawled note was pinned to the top. This is on loan, it said. We\u2019ll want these back when you\u2019re done.",
    "Silver afforded London all of its modern conveniences. Silver powered the ice-making machines in the kitchens of London\u2019s rich. Silver powered the engines of the breweries which supplied London\u2019s pubs, and the mills which produced London\u2019s flour. Without silver, the locomotives would cease to run. No new railways could be built. The water would run foul; the air would thicken with grime. When all the machines that mechanized the processes of spinning, weaving, carding, and roving ground to a halt, Britain\u2019s textile industry would wholly collapse.",
    "These effects would not be fully felt for months. There were still regional silver-working centres in London, Liverpool, Edinburgh, and Birmingham, where Babel scholars who hadn\u2019t dazzled enough during their undergraduate years to win fellowships eked out a mundane living fiddling with the bars invented by their more talented peers. These centres would function as a stopgap in the interim. But they could not fully make up the deficit \u2013 especially since, crucially, they did not have access to the same maintenance ledgers.",
    "\u2018They\u2019re academics,\u2019 said Professor Craft. \u2018All we know is the life of the mind. We don\u2019t remember anything unless it\u2019s written in our diaries and circled several times over. Jerome will do his very best, supposing he\u2019s not still drugged up from surgery, but too much will slip through the cracks. This country\u2019s going to pieces in months.\u2019",
    "\u2018And the economy is going to fail even more quickly than that,\u2019 said Yusuf, who, alone among them, actually knew something about markets and banking. \u2018It\u2019s all the speculation, see \u2013 people have been going mad buying shares in railways and other silver-powered industries in the past decade because they all think they\u2019re on the verge of getting rich. What happens when they realize all those shares will come to naught? The rail industry might take months to falter. The markets themselves will fail in weeks.\u2019",
    "For that was the key, wasn\u2019t it? For this to work, they had to frighten the rich and powerful. They knew the strike would have a disproportionate impact on the working poor; those living in the dirtiest, most crowded parts of London, who could not simply pack up and escape to the country when their air blackened and their water grew foul. But in another important sense, silver scarcity would most acutely hit those who had the most to gain from its development. The newest buildings \u2013 the private clubs, the dance halls, the freshly renovated theatres \u2013 would collapse first.",
    "London\u2019s shabby tenements were built from ordinary lumber, not foundations enhanced by silver to support weight much heavier than natural materials could. The architect Augustus Pugin was a frequent collaborator of Babel\u2019s faculty, and had made great use of silver bars in his recent projects \u2013 Scarisbrick Hall in Lancashire, the Alton Towers renovation, and most notably, the rebuilding of the Palace of Westminster after the 1834 fire. According to the work-order ledgers, all these buildings would fail by the end of the year. Sooner, if the right rods were pulled away..",
    "The strikers gave fair warning. They loudly advertised this information. They wrote endless pamphlets, which Abel communicated to associates in London. Your roads will fail, they wrote. Your water will run dry. Your lights will go dark, your food will rot, and your ships sink. All this will come to pass, unless you choose peace.",
    "\u2018Moses asked Pharaoh to let his people go,\u2019 said Victoire. \u2018But Pharaoh\u2019s heart was unyielding, and he refused. So the Lord cast ten plagues on the Pharaoh\u2019s land. He turned the Nile to blood. He sent locusts, frogs, and pestilence. He cast all of Egypt into darkness, and through these feats he made Pharaoh know his power.\u2019",
    "Occasionally the effects of the strike reversed themselves. Sometimes the lights would flicker back on for a night, or a patchwork of roads would clear up, or news would spread that clean water silver-work was now available and selling at exorbitant prices in certain neighbourhoods of London. Occasionally the disaster the ledgers predicted did not come to pass.",
    "This was not a surprise. The exiled scholars \u2013 Professor De Vreese, Professor Harding, and all the faculty and fellows who had not remained in the tower \u2013 had regrouped in London and established a defence society to counteract the strikers. The country now lay in the throes of an invisible battle of words and meaning; its fate teetered between the university centre and the desperate, striving periphery.",
    "The strikers were not concerned. The exiles could not win; they simply lacked the tower\u2019s resources. They could stick their fingers in the mud. They could not stop the river from flowing, nor the dam from bursting.",
    "\u2018Well, it\u2019s just so funny,\u2019 said Professor Chakravarti. \u2018Technically, those supplementary stations do exist, precisely to alleviate such a crisis of dependence. Cambridge, for example, has been trying to establish a rival programme for years. But Oxford wouldn\u2019t share any resources.\u2019",
    "Still Parliament refused to cooperate. Every night the Foreign Office sent them the same telegram, always worded in precisely the same way, as if shouting a message over and over again could induce obedience: CEASE STRIKE NOW STOP. In a week, these offers stopped including an offer of amnesty. Shortly after that, they came with a rather redundant threat attached: CEASE STRIKE NOW STOP OR ARMY WILL TAKE BACK THE TOWER STOP.",
    "Very soon the effects of their strike became deadly.* One of the major breaking points, it turned out, was the roads. In Oxford, but even more so in London, traffic was the dominant problem facing city officials \u2013 how to manage the flow of carts, horses, pedestrians, stagecoaches, hackney carriages, and wagons without gridlock or accidents. Silver-work had kept pile-ups at bay by reinforcing wooden roads, regulating turnpikes, reinforcing toll gates and bridges, ensuring smooth turns by carts, replenishing the water pumps meant for suppressing dust, and keeping horses docile.",
    "Transportation tipped the domino that led to a slew of other miseries. Grocers could not stock their shelves. Bakers could not obtain flour. Doctors could not see their patients. Solicitors could not make it to court. A dozen carriages in London\u2019s richer neighbourhoods had made use of a match-pair by Professor Lovell that played on the Chinese character \u8f14 (f\u01d4), which meant \u2018to help\u2019 or \u2018to assist\u2019. The character had originally referred to the protective sidebars on a carriage. Professor Lovell had been due in London to touch them up mid-January. The bars failed.",
    "Everything they knew would transpire in London was already happening in Oxford, for Oxford, by proximity to Babel, was the most silver-reliant city in the world. And Oxford was rotting. Its people were going broke, they were hungry, their trades had been interrupted, their rivers were blocked up, their markets had shut down. They sent out to London for food and supplies, but the roads had become perilous, and the Oxford-to-Paddington line was no longer running.",
    "The attacks on the tower redoubled. Townspeople and soldiers together crowded the streets, shouting obscenities at the windows, skirmishing with men at the barricades. But it made no difference. They could not hurt the translators, who were the only people who could end their misery. They could not get past the tower\u2019s wards, could not burn it down or set explosives at its base. They could only beg the scholars to stop.",
    "We only have two demands, Robin wrote in a series of pamphlets, which had become his way of responding to the town\u2019s outcries. Parliament knows this. Refusal to go to war, and amnesty. Your fate lies in their hands.",
    "He requested that London capitulate before all these things came to pass. He hoped, and knew, they would not. He had fully converted now to Griffin\u2019s theory of violence, that the oppressor would never sit down at the negotiating table when they still thought they had nothing to lose. No; things had to get bloody. Until now, all threats had been hypothetical. London had to suffer to learn.",
    "Victoire did not like this. Every time they ascended to the eighth floor, they quarrelled over which resonance bars to pull out, and how many. He wanted to deactivate two dozen; she wanted only two. Usually, they settled on five or six.",
    "\u2018I\u2019m not being squeamish; I\u2019m being prudent.\u2019 Victoire folded her arms. \u2018It\u2019s too fast, Robin. It\u2019s too much all at once. You need to let the debates settle. You need to let public opinion turn against the war\u2014\u2019",
    "No one knew what was going on inside the House of Lords, except that neither the Whigs nor the Radicals felt good enough about their numbers yet to call a vote. The papers revealed more about public sentiment.",
    "The mainstream rags expressed the opinion Robin had expected, which was that the war on China was a matter of defending national pride, that invasion was nothing more than a just punishment for the indignities imposed by the Chinese on the British flag, that the occupation of Babel by foreign-born students was an act of treason, that the barricades in Oxford and the strikes in London were the work of brutish malcontents, and that the government ought to hold firm against their demands. Prowar editorials stressed the ease with which China would be defeated.",
    "The papers could not seem to make up their minds about the translators. The prowar publications offered a dozen theories. They were in cahoots with the corrupt Chinese government. They were co-conspirators of mutineers in India. They were malicious ingrates with no agenda at all except a desire to hurt England, to bite the hand that had fed them \u2013 and this required no further explanation, for it was a motive that the British public were all too ready to believe. We will not negotiate with Babel, promised members of Parliament on both sides. Britain does not bow to foreigners.*",
    "Yet not all the papers were against Babel or for the war. Indeed, for every headline that urged swift action in Canton, there was another by a publication (albeit smaller, more niche, more radical) that called the war a moral and religious outrage. The Spectator accused the prowar party of greed and profiteering; the Examiner called the war criminal and indefensible. JARDINE\u2019S OPIUM WAR A DISGRACE, read one headline by the Champion. Others were not so tactful: DRUGGY MCDRUGGY WANTS HIS THUMBS IN CHINA read the Political Register.",
    "Every social faction in England had an opinion. The abolitionists put out statements of support for the strikers. So too did the suffragists, though not quite so loudly. Christian organizations printed pamphlets criticizing the spread of an illegal vice to an innocent people, though the prowar evangelists responded with the supposedly Christian argument that it would in fact be God\u2019s work to expose the Chinese people to free trade.",
    "Meanwhile, Radical publications made the argument that the opening up of China was antithetical to the interests of workers in northern England. The Chartists, a movement of disillusioned industrial and artisanal workers, came out most strongly in support of the strikers; the Chartist circular The Red Republican, in fact, put out a headline calling the translators heroes of the working class.",
    "This gave Robin hope. The Radicals were, after all, the party that the Whigs needed to appease, and if such headlines could convince the Radicals that war was not in their long-term interests, then perhaps all this could be resolved.",
    "And indeed, the conversation about the dangers of silver-work had fared better in the court of public opinion than did the conversation about China. Here was an issue that was close to home, that affected the average Briton in ways he could understand. The silver industrial revolution had decimated both the textile and agricultural industries.",
    "The papers ran piece after piece exposing the horrific working conditions inside silver-powered factories (although these had their rebuttals, including one refutation by Andrew Ure, who argued that factory workers would feel a good deal better if they only consumed less gin and tobacco). In 1833, the surgeon Peter Gaskell had published a thoroughly researched manuscript entitled The Manufacturing Population of England, focusing chiefly on the moral, social, and physical toll of silver-working machinery on British labourers.",
    "It had gone largely unheeded at the time, except by the Radicals, who were known to exaggerate everything. Now, the antiwar papers ran excerpts from it every day, reporting in grisly detail the coal dust inhaled by small children forced to wriggle into tunnels that adults could not, the fingers and toes lost to silver-powered machines working at inhuman speeds, the girls who\u2019d been strangled by their own hair caught in whirring spindles and looms..",
    "The Spectator printed a cartoon illustration of emaciated children being crushed to death under the wheels of some nebulous contraption, which they captioned WHITE SLAVES OF THE SILVER REVOLUTION. In the tower, they laughed themselves silly over this comparison, but the general public seemed genuinely horrified.",
    "Someone asked a member of the House of Lords why he supported exploiting children in factories; he replied quite flippantly that employing children under the age of nine had been outlawed in 1833, which led to more general outcry over the suffering of ten- and eleven-year-olds in the country..",
    "\u2018Worse,\u2019 said Abel. \u2018Those are just the freak accidents they\u2019re reporting on. But they don\u2019t say what it\u2019s like to work day after day on those cramped floors. Rising before dawn and working until nine with few breaks in between. And those are the conditions we covet. The jobs we wish we could get back. I imagine they don\u2019t make you work half as hard at university, do they?\u2019",
    "The Spectator story seemed to greatly affect Professor Craft in particular. Robin found her sitting with it at the tea table, red in the eyes, long after the others had finished their breakfast. She hastily wiped her eyes with a handkerchief when she saw him approach.",
    "She seemed not to hear him. She stared out of the window at the green below, where the strikers\u2019 protest grounds had been turned into what looked like a military camp. \u2018My first patented match-pair improved the efficiency of equipment at a mine in Tyneshire,\u2019 she said. \u2018It kept coal-laden trolleys firmly on their tracks. The mine owners were so impressed they invited me up for a visit, and of course I went; I was so excited about contributing something to the country. I remember being shocked at all the little children in the pits.",
    "She took a shaky breath. \u2018Later they told me that the silver-work made the trolleys impossible to move off the tracks, even when there were people in the way. There was an accident. One little boy lost both his legs. They stopped using the match-pair when they couldn\u2019t figure out a workaround, but I didn\u2019t give it a second thought. By then I\u2019d received my fellowship. I had a professorship in sight, and I\u2019d moved on to other, bigger projects. I didn\u2019t think about it. I simply didn\u2019t think about it, for years, and years and years.\u2019",
    "She turned back towards him. Her eyes were wet. \u2018Only it builds up, doesn\u2019t it? It doesn\u2019t just disappear. And one day you start prodding at what you\u2019ve suppressed. And it\u2019s a mass of black rot, and it\u2019s endless, horrifying, and you can\u2019t look away.\u2019",
    "They were holed up in an office on the sixth floor, poring through the ledgers to find portents of future disasters. They\u2019d already been through the Oxford town appointments up to the next year. London\u2019s maintenance schedules were harder to find \u2013 Babel\u2019s bookkeeping was astonishingly bad, and the categorization system used by its clerks seemed not to be organized by date, which would have been logical, or by language, which would have made less but at least some sense, but by the postal code of the London neighbourhood in question.",
    "\u2018They\u2019re due for maintenance on Westminster Bridge in a week. They contracted for silver-work at the same time that the New London Bridge was built in 1825, and the bars were meant to expire after fifteen years. That\u2019s now.\u2019",
    "\u2018I don\u2019t think so, it was quite a major . . . F is code for foundation, isn\u2019t it?\u2019 Robin trailed off, then fell silent. His eyes darted up and down the ledger, trying to confirm what was in front of him. It was quite a large entry, a list of silver bars and match-pairs in various languages that stretched nearly half a page. A good number of them had corresponding numbers in a subsequent column \u2013 an indication they employed resonance links. He turned the page, then blinked. The column continued over the next two pages. \u2018I think it just falls right into the river.\u2019",
    "The implications were enormous. Westminster Bridge was not the only bridge to cross the Thames, but it saw the heaviest traffic. And if Westminster Bridge fell into the river, then no steamers, no houseboats, no sculls or canoes would be able to get around the wreckage. If Westminster Bridge went down, the whole city stopped moving.",
    "And in the weeks to come, when the bars that kept the Thames clean of sewage and pollution from gas factories and chemical works at last expired, the waters would revert to a state of diseased and putrid fermentation. Fish would float belly-up to the surface, dead and stinking. Urine and feces, already moving sluggishly through sewer drains, would solidify.",
    "But as Robin explained this, Victoire\u2019s face mirrored none of his glee. Rather, she was looking at him with a very odd expression, brows furrowed and lips pursed, and it turned his insides with discomfort.",
    "They\u2019d had this argument before. The ghosts of Anthony and Griffin loomed between them: one guided by the conviction that the enemy would at least act in rational self-interest, if not altruism, and the other guided less by conviction, less by telos, and more by sheer, untrammelled rage.",
    "The vote came out narrowly in Robin\u2019s favour. Victoire and the professors were against; all the students were for. The students agreed with Robin that they had to push Parliament to the breaking point, but they were not thrilled about it. Ibrahim and Juliana both hugged their arms against their chest as they voted, as if shrinking from the idea. Even Yusuf, who usually took great pleasure in helping Robin compose threatening pamphlets to London, stared down at his feet.",
    "\u2018And you are comfortable with this?\u2019 Professor Chakravarti glanced about, as if trying to gauge the moral temperature of the room. \u2018Dozens of people will die. There are whole crowds there trying to get on boats at all times of day; what happens when\u2014\u2019",
    "\u2018You know very well that doesn\u2019t matter,\u2019 said Professor Chakravarti. \u2018Don\u2019t mince the ethics. Westminster Bridge falling down is your choice. But innocent people can\u2019t determine the whims of Parliament.\u2019",
    "\u2018But it\u2019s their government\u2019s duty to look out for them,\u2019 said Robin. \u2018That\u2019s the entire point of Parliament, isn\u2019t it? Meanwhile, we don\u2019t have the option of civility. Or grace. It\u2019s an indiscriminate torch, I\u2019ll admit that, but that\u2019s what the stakes demand. You can\u2019t put the moral blame on me.\u2019 He swallowed. \u2018You can\u2019t.\u2019",
    "\u2018But that\u2019s precisely the devil\u2019s trick,\u2019 Robin insisted. \u2018This is how colonialism works. It convinces us that the fallout from resistance is entirely our fault, that the immoral choice is resistance itself rather than the circumstances that demanded it.\u2019",
    "\u2018You\u2019re trying to win by punishing the city,\u2019 said Professor Chakravarti. \u2018That means the whole city, everyone in it \u2013 men, women, children. There are sick children who can\u2019t get their medicine. There are whole families with no income and no source of food. This is more than an inconvenience to them, it\u2019s a death threat.\u2019",
    "They glared at each other, and Robin thought he understood now the way that Griffin had once looked at him. This was a failure of nerve. A refusal to push things to the limit. Violence was the only thing that brought the colonizer to the table; violence was the only option. The gun was right there, lying on the table, waiting for them to pick it up. Why were they so afraid to even look at it?",
    "\u2018Turn out your pockets.\u2019 Robin raised his voice, speaking over the ringing in his ears. \u2018Take nothing with you \u2013 not silver, not ledgers, not notes you\u2019ve written to yourself.\u2019 He kept waiting for someone to interrupt him; for Victoire to intervene, to tell him he was wrong, but no one spoke. He took this silence as tacit approval. \u2018And if you leave, I\u2019m sure you know, you can\u2019t come back.\u2019",
    "But no, that was not true; they both knew it. The British did not hate them, because hate was bound up with fear and resentment, and both required seeing your opponent as a morally autonomous being, worthy of respect and rivalry. The attitude the British held towards the Chinese was patronizing, was dismissive; but it was not hatred. Not yet.",
    "But then, Robin thought, invoking hatred might be good. Hatred might force respect. Hatred might force the British to look them in the eyes and see not an object, but a person. Violence shocks the system, Griffin had told him. And the system cannot survive the shock.",
    "\u2018Many think ahimsa means absolute pacifism, and that the Indian people are therefore a sheepish, submissive people who will bend the knee to anything. But in the Bhagavad Gita, exceptions are made for a dharma yuddha. A righteous war. A war in which violence is applied as the last resort, a war fought not for selfish gain or personal motives but from a commitment to a greater cause.\u2019 He shook his head. \u2018This is how I have justified this strike, Mr Swift. But what you\u2019re doing here is not self-defence; it has trespassed into malice.",
    "No one else said a word. Professor Craft stood and walked away up the stairs. A moment later, Ibrahim joined her, then Juliana; and then the rest until only Robin and Victoire stood in the lobby, watching Professor Chakravarti stride down the front steps towards the barricades.",
    "In the early days of the strike, they\u2019d been too occupied with the exigencies of their situation \u2013 with pamphleteering, ledgers research, and barricade fortifications \u2013 to pay attention to the sheer danger they were in. It had all been so monumental, so unifying. They\u2019d delighted in each other\u2019s company. They\u2019d talked long into the nights, learning about one another, marvelling at how astonishingly similar their histories were. They\u2019d been plucked from their motherlands at a very young age, thrown into England, and instructed to thrive or be deported.",
    "But the frantic preparations of those early days had now given way to gloomy, suffocating hours. All the pieces had been laid on the board; all hands were shown. They had no threats left to make other than ones they\u2019d already shouted from the rooftops. What stretched before them now was only time, a ticking down to the inevitable collapse.",
    "This decision had left a bad taste in their mouths. They\u2019d said all there was to say, and no one wanted pick apart the implications. Introspection was dangerous; they only wanted to get through the day. Now, more often than not, they drifted to separate corners of the tower, reading or researching or doing whatever it was they did to make the time pass. Ibrahim and Juliana spent all their waking hours together.",
    "Sometimes the rest of them speculated whether the two might be falling in love, but they found they could never sustain that conversation; it made them think of the future, of how this might all end up, and that made them too sad. Yusuf kept to himself. Meghana occasionally took tea with Robin and Victoire, and they would exchange stories about their overlapping acquaintances \u2013 she\u2019d graduated recently, and had been close to both Vimal and Anthony \u2013 but as the days drew on she also started withdrawing into herself.",
    "Life in the tower, life on strike \u2013 at first so novel and strangely exciting \u2013 took on a routine, monotonous air. Things were hard going at first. It was both funny and embarrassing, how little they\u2019d learned about how to keep their living quarters in order. No one knew where the brooms were kept, so the floors remained dusty and littered with crumbs.",
    "No one knew how to do laundry \u2013 they tried producing a match-pair using the word bleach and words derived from the Proto-Indo-European root bhel (\u2018shining white, to flash, to burn\u2019), but all this did was temporarily turn their clothes white and scorching-hot to the touch..",
    "They still congregated for meals three times a day on the hour, if only because that made rationing simpler. Their luxury items had quickly disappeared. There was no coffee after the first week; they were close to running out of tea by the second. Their solution to this was to dilute the tea more and more until they were drinking little more than slightly discoloured water. There was no milk or sugar to speak of. Meghana argued they ought to just enjoy the last few teaspoons in a properly, full-brewed cup, but Professor Craft vehemently disagreed.",
    "She was furious with him, he knew. The first two days they spent together in begrudging silence \u2013 but together, still, because they needed each other for solace. They spent hours by the sixth-floor window, sitting shoulder to shoulder on the floor. He did not press his point. She made no recriminations. There was nothing more to say. The course was set.",
    "By the third day the silence became unbearable, so they began to talk; small nothings at first, and then everything that came to mind. Sometimes they reminisced about Babel, about the golden years before everything turned upside down. Sometimes they suspended reality, managed to forget everything that had happened, and gossiped about their college days as if the most important matter at hand was whether Colin Thornhill and the Sharp twins would get into fisticuffs over Bill Jameson\u2019s pretty, visiting sister.",
    "Robin did it first. Letty had lingered in the back of both their memories like a festering sore they didn\u2019t dare touch, and he couldn\u2019t keep circling around it anymore. He wanted to take a burning knife and dig into the rot.",
    "Victoire didn\u2019t need to ask who he meant. \u2018It was like an exercise in hope,\u2019 she said after a pause. \u2018Loving her, I mean. Sometimes I\u2019d think she\u2019d come around. Sometimes I\u2019d look her in the eyes and think that I was looking at a true friend. Then she\u2019d say something, make some off-the-cuff comment, and the whole cycle would begin all over again. It was like pouring sand into a sieve. Nothing stuck.\u2019",
    "His mind did what it always did, which was to summon a Chinese character in lieu of the thought he was afraid of. \u2018When I think of Letty, I think about the character x\u00ec.\u2019 He drew it in the air for her: \u9699. \u2018It\u2019s most commonly used to mean \u201ca crack or a fissure\u201d. But in Classical Chinese texts, it also means \u201ca grudge, or a feud\u201d. According to rumours, the Qing Emperor uses a bar engraved with the x\u00ec-feud match-pair installed under a stone mural of the imperial lineage. And when cracks appear, it shows that someone is plotting against him.\u2019 He swallowed.",
    "\u2018I think she wanted him dead,\u2019 he continued hoarsely. \u2018You could see it on her face \u2013 she wasn\u2019t scared, she knew what she was doing, she could have aimed at any one of us, and she knew it was Ramy she wanted.\u2019",
    "\u2018She loved him, you know,\u2019 he said. The words came out of him like a torrent now; the floodgates were broken, and the waters could not be stopped. No matter how devastating, how tragic, he had to say it out loud, had to burden someone else with this awful, awful suspicion. \u2018She told me, the night of the commemoration ball \u2013 she spent nearly an hour weeping into my shoulder because she wanted to dance with him, and he wouldn\u2019t even look at her. He never looked at her, he didn\u2019t . . .\u2019 He had to stop; his tears threatened to choke him.",
    "Victoire said nothing for a long time. She gazed out over the crumbling city, thinking. At last, she pulled a rumpled piece of paper from her pocket and pressed it into his hand. \u2018You should have this.\u2019",
    "Robin unfolded it. It was the daguerreotype portrait of the four of them, folded and refolded so many times that thin white lines crisscrossed the image. But their faces were printed so clearly. Letty, glaring proudly, her face a bit strained after such a long time. Ramy\u2019s hands affectionately on both her and Victoire\u2019s shoulders. Victoire\u2019s half-smile; chin tilted down, eyes raised and luminous. His own awkward shyness. Ramy\u2019s grin.",
    "\u2018We were happy then.\u2019 Victoire glanced down, fingers tracing their fading faces. \u2018I thought about burning it, you know. I wanted the satisfaction. At Oxford Castle I kept taking it out, studying her face, trying to see . . . to see the person that would do this to us. But the more I look, the more I . . . I just feel sorry for her. It\u2019s twisted, but from her perspective, she must think she\u2019s the one who lost everything. She was so alone, you know. All she wanted was a group of friends, people who could understand what she\u2019d been through.",
    "\u2018I think no one knows how this is going to end,\u2019 said Ibrahim. \u2018But I know what they\u2019ll say about us if it ends badly. When those students in Paris died at the barricades, everyone called them heroes. But if we die here, no one\u2019s going to think we\u2019re martyrs. And I just want to make sure some record of us exists, a record that doesn\u2019t make us out to be the villains.\u2019 Ibrahim glanced at Robin. \u2018But you don\u2019t like this project, do you?\u2019",
    "\u2018No, I\u2019m sorry, I just . . .\u2019 Robin didn\u2019t know why he found it so hard to put the words together. \u2018I suppose I just don\u2019t like thinking of us as history when we haven\u2019t even yet made a mark on the present.\u2019",
    "Robin felt a very heavy weight on his chest then. He wanted to start talking, to spill out everything he knew and have it preserved in ink, but the words died on his tongue. He didn\u2019t know how to articulate that the problem was not the existence of the record itself, but the fact that it wasn\u2019t enough, that it was such an insufficient intervention against the archives that it felt pointless.",
    "There was so much to say. He didn\u2019t know where to begin. He had never thought before about the lacuna of written history they existed in and the oppressive swath of denigrating narrative they fought against, and now that he did, it seemed insurmountable. The record was so blank. No chronicle of the Hermes Society existed at all except this one. Hermes had operated like the best of clandestine societies, erasing its own history even as it changed Britain\u2019s. No one would celebrate their achievements. No one would even know what they were.",
    "He thought of the Old Library, destroyed and dismantled, all those mountains of research locked away and hidden forever from view. He thought of that envelope, lost to ash; of the dozens of Hermes associates who\u2019d never been contacted, who might never know what had happened. He thought of all those years Griffin spent abroad \u2013 fighting, struggling, railing against a system that was infinitely more powerful than he was. Robin would never know the full extent of what his brother had done, what he\u2019d suffered. So much history, erased.",
    "Robin wondered in the days that followed if what they\u2019d felt that night was a shared sense of mortality, akin to how soldiers felt sitting in trenches at war. For it was war, what was breaking out on those streets. Westminster Bridge had not fallen, not yet, but the accidents continued and the shortages grew worse. London\u2019s patience was strained. The public demanded retribution, demanded action, in some form or another. And since Parliament would not vote no on the China invasion, they simply increased their pressure on the Army.",
    "It appeared the guardsmen had orders to leave the tower itself alone, but were permitted to aim at individual scholars when they got the chance. Robin stopped venturing outside when a rendezvous with Abel Goodfellow was interrupted by a spate of rifle fire. Once, a window shattered next to Victoire\u2019s head when she was searching the stacks for a book. They all dropped to the floor and crawled on hands and knees to the basement, where they were protected by walls on all sides. Later they found a bullet lodged in the shelf just behind where she\u2019d been standing.",
    "Curious, Robin examined the bullet: thick, warped, and unnaturally cold to the touch. He held it up to the light and saw a thin band of silver lining the base of the casing. \u2018I suppose Professor Playfair thought of something.\u2019",
    "That raised the stakes. Babel was not impenetrable. This was not a strike any longer, but a siege. If the soldiers broke through the barricades, if soldiers wielding Professor Playfair\u2019s inventions reached the front door, their strike was effectively over. Professor Craft and Professor Chakravarti had replaced Professor Playfair\u2019s wards on their first night in the tower, but even they admitted they were not as good at this as Professor Playfair had been; they were not sure how well their own defences would hold up.",
    "For now the barricades held, though outside, the skirmishing had turned vicious. Initially Abel Goodfellow\u2019s strikers had fought a purely defensive war from behind the barricades. They reinforced their structures, they ran supply lines, but they did not provoke the guardsmen. Now the streets had turned bloody. Soldiers fired regularly now on the barricaders, and the barricaders struck back in turn. They made incendiary devices with cloth, oil, and bottles and hurled them at the Army camps.",
    "It shouldn\u2019t have been so evenly matched, civilians against guardsmen. In theory, they shouldn\u2019t have lasted a week. But many of Abel\u2019s men were veterans, men discharged from an army falling into disrepair after the defeat of Napoleon. They knew where to find firearms. They knew what to do with them.",
    "The translators helped. Victoire, who\u2019d been reading furiously through French dissident literature, composed the match-pair \u00e9lan-energy, the latter of which bore connotations of a particular French revolutionary zeal, and which could be traced back to the Latin lancea, meaning \u2018lance\u2019. Carried through was an association with throwing and momentum, and it was this latent distortion into the English energy that helped the barricaders\u2019 projectiles fly further, hit truer, and make more of an impact than bricks and cobblestones ought to have been able to do.",
    "They\u2019d come up with a few wilder ideas which bore no fruit. The word seduce came from the Latin seducere, meaning \u2018to lead astray\u2019, from which the late-fifteenth-century definition \u2018to persuade one to abandon their allegiance\u2019 came about. This seemed promising, but they could not think of a way to manifest it without sending the girls into the front lines, which no one was willing to suggest, or dressing up Abel\u2019s men in women\u2019s clothes, which seemed unlikely to work.",
    "There was also the German word Nachtmahr, a now rarely used word for \u2018nightmare\u2019, which also referred to a malicious entity that sat upon the sleeper\u2019s chest. Some experimentation proved this match-pair made bad dreams worse when one had them, but seemed unable to induce them in the first place..",
    "Day after day, the barricades held. Robin found it amazing that they didn\u2019t shatter under the weight of the near constant cannon fire, but Abel was confident they could hold out indefinitely as long as they kept scrounging up new materials to bolster the damaged sections.",
    "\u2018Sometimes. Sometimes they shot them dead on sight. But other times \u2013 well, think about it. You\u2019re looking someone in the eyes. They\u2019re around your age, or younger. From the same city. Possibly the same neighbourhood. Possibly you know them, or you see in their face someone you could know. Would you pull the trigger?\u2019",
    "\u2018Every soldier\u2019s conscience has a limit,\u2019 said Abel. \u2018I suppose they\u2019ll try to arrest us. But firing on townspeople? Carrying out a massacre? I\u2019m not so sure. But we\u2019ll force that split. We\u2019ll see what happens.\u2019",
    "It will all be over soon. They tried to reassure themselves at night when they looked out over the city, saw the torchlight and cannon fire burning bright. They needed only to hold out until Saturday. Parliament could not sustain this any longer than they could. They could not let Westminster Bridge fall.",
    "Then, always, the strange, tentative imagining of what a ceasefire might look like. Should they write up a contract with terms of amnesty? Yusuf took charge of this, drafting a treaty that saved them from the gallows.",
    "When the tower resumed normal functioning, would they be a part of it? What did scholarship look like in the age after empire, when they knew Britain\u2019s silver stores would dwindle into nothing? They had never considered these questions before, but now, when the outcome of this strike stood on a razor\u2019s edge, their only comfort was in prognosticating the future in such detail that it seemed possible..",
    "There was no future without Ramy, without Griffin, without Anthony and Cathy and Ilse and Vimal. As far as he was concerned, time had stopped when Letty\u2019s bullet had left the chamber. All there was now was the fallout. What happened after was for someone else to struggle through. Robin only wanted it all to end.",
    "They followed him to the rooftop. With his naked eye Robin could see a commotion up north in Jericho, a frenzied movement of the crowd, but it took a moment of fumbling with a telescope before he honed in on what the gunmen were pointing at.",
    "Soldiers and labourers at the Jericho barricade had just exchanged fire, the gunman told them. Usually this led to nothing \u2013 warning shots echoed throughout the city at all times, and the sides usually took turns firing before retreating back down behind the barricades. Symbolic; it was all supposed to be symbolic. But this time a body had toppled.",
    "The telescope lens revealed a startling amount of detail. The victim was young, she was white, she was fair-haired and pretty, and the blood blossoming from her stomach stained the ground a vivid, unmistakable scarlet. Against the slate-grey cobblestones, it looked like a flag.",
    "She wasn\u2019t wearing trousers. The women who\u2019d joined the barricades usually wore trousers. She had on a shawl and a flowing skirt, and an upturned basket still hung from her left arm. She could have been on her way to buy groceries. She could have been on her way home to a husband, to parents, to children.",
    "They congregated in the basement, huddled nervously, eyes darting around like frightened children who had just done something very naughty. This was the first civilian casualty of the barricades, and it was momentous. The line had been breached.",
    "\u2018We don\u2019t stop,\u2019 said Robin. The strength of his voice stunned him. It came from someplace beyond him. It sounded older; it sounded like Griffin\u2019s. And it must have resonated, for the voices quieted, and all faces turned towards him, scared, expectant, hopeful. \u2018This is when the tides turn. This was the most foolish thing they could have done.\u2019 Blood thundered in his ears. \u2018Before, the whole city was against us, don\u2019t you see? But now the Army\u2019s messed up. They\u2019ve shot one of the townsfolk. There\u2019s no coming back from that. Do you think Oxford\u2019s going to support the Army now?\u2019",
    "Well, why not admit it? He was not ashamed. He was right. This girl, whoever she was, was a symbol; she proved that empire had no restraints, that empire would do anything to protect itself. Go on, he thought; do it again; kill more of them; turn the streets red with the blood of your own. Show them who you are. Show them their whiteness won\u2019t save them. Here, at last, was an unforgivable offence with a clear perpetrator. The Army had killed this girl. And if Oxford wanted vengeance, there was only one way to get it.",
    "That night Oxford\u2019s streets exploded into proper violence. The fighting started at the far end of the city, at Jericho where the first blood was shed, and gradually spread as more and more points of conflict developed. The cannon fire was constant. The whole city was awake with shouts and rioting, and Robin saw on those streets more people than he had ever imagined lived in Oxford.",
    "Insane was not enough to cover it, Robin thought. English was insufficient to describe all this. His mind wandered to old Chinese texts, the idioms they employed about dynastic collapse and change. \u5929\u7ffb\u5730\u8986; ti\u0101nf\u0101nd\u00ecf\u00f9. The heavens fell, and the earth collapsed in on itself. The world turned upside down. Britain was spilling its own blood, Britain was gouging out its own flesh, and nothing after this could go back to the way it had been before.",
    "\u2018It won\u2019t last,\u2019 said Abel. \u2018They\u2019re angry now, but they\u2019re not soldiers. They\u2019ve got no endurance. I\u2019ve seen this before. By the early hours of the night, they\u2019ll start straggling home. And I\u2019ve just had word from the Army that at dawn, they\u2019ll start firing on whoever\u2019s still out there.\u2019",
    "\u2018We\u2019re down to the last circle of barriers. High Street is all we\u2019ve got. There\u2019s no pretence of civility any longer. They\u2019ll break through; it\u2019s not a question of if, but when. And the fact is, we\u2019re a civilian uprising and they\u2019re a trained, armed battalion with reinforcements to spare. If history is anything to go by, if this really does become a battle, then we\u2019re going to get crushed. We aren\u2019t keen on a repeat of Peterloo.\u2019* Abel sighed. \u2018The illusion of restraint could only ever last so long. I hope we\u2019ve bought you time.\u2019",
    "\u2018Well then.\u2019 Robin felt a roil of frustration but forced it down; it wasn\u2019t fair to blame Abel for these developments, nor was it fair to ask him to stay any longer, when all he would face was near certain death or arrest. \u2018Thank you, I suppose. Thank you for everything.\u2019",
    "\u2018I\u2019m telling you this is your chance to get out. We\u2019ll start ferrying people away before the shooting gets properly vicious. A few of us will stay to defend the barricades, and that\u2019ll distract them long enough to get the rest out to the Cotswolds, at least.\u2019",
    "What he meant: Can you make that decision? Can you tell me everyone in there wants to die? And he was right to ask, because no, Robin could not speak for all seven remaining scholars; in fact, he realized, he had no idea what they would choose to do next.",
    "Robin steeled himself a moment before going back upstairs. He didn\u2019t know how to tell them this was the end. His face kept threatening to crumple, to reveal the scared boy hiding behind the ghost of his older brother. He had roped all these people into this last stand; he could not bear the sight of their faces when he told them it was over.",
    "She had a point. More than a dozen troops had halted on High Street, but only five soldiers proceeded the rest of the way towards the tower. As they watched, the soldiers parted, and a solitary figure stepped through their ranks up to the final remaining barricade.",
    "They sent everyone else upstairs before they opened the door. Letty was not here to negotiate with the crowd; they would not have sent an undergraduate to do so. This was personal; Letty was here for a reckoning.",
    "Abel spoke a word to his man, who ran across the green to inform the barricaders. Two men climbed on top of the barricade and bent down. A moment later Letty was lifted over the top, then lowered none-too-gently down onto the other side.",
    "She looked miserable. She had clearly not been sleeping; her clothes were dirty and rumpled, her cheeks hollow, and her eyes red and puffy from crying. The way she hunched her shoulders around her, as if flinching from a blow, made her look very small. And despite himself, despite everything, all Robin wanted then was to give her a hug.",
    "This instinct startled him. As she\u2019d approached the tower he\u2019d entertained, briefly, the thought of killing her \u2013 if only her death did not doom them all, if only he could just throw his own life into the bargain. But it was so hard to look at her now and not see a friend. How could you love someone who had hurt you so badly? Up close, staring her in the eyes, he had trouble believing that this Letty, their Letty, had done the things she had. She looked grief-stricken, vulnerable, the wretched heroine of a terrible fairy tale.",
    "But that, he reminded himself, was the advantage of the image Letty occupied. In this country, she had the face and colouring that inspired sympathy. Among them, no matter what happened, Letty alone could walk out of here innocent.",
    "For a moment the three of them only looked at each other. They stood uncertain in the middle of the lobby, an unbalanced triangle. It felt so fundamentally wrong. There had always been four of them; they had always come in pairs, an even set, and all Robin could think of was the acute absence of Ramy among them. They were not themselves without him; without his laughter, his quick, easy wit, his sudden turns of conversation that made them feel like they were spinning plates. They were no longer a cohort. Now they were only a wake.",
    "\u2018You were in the thrall of a violent criminal organization,\u2019 said Letty. The words came out so smoothly Robin could only assume they had been rehearsed. \u2018And unless I pretended I agreed with you, unless I played along, I didn\u2019t see how I was going to get out of there alive.\u2019",
    "Did she truly believe that? Robin wondered. Was that how she\u2019d always seen them? He couldn\u2019t believe these words were coming out of her mouth, that this was the same girl who\u2019d once stayed up late with them, laughing so hard their ribs had ached. Only Chinese had a character that encapsulated how much simple words could hurt: \u523a, c\u00ec, the character for thorns, for stabs, for criticism. Such a flexible character. In a phrase, \u523a\u8a00, \u523a\u8a9e, it meant \u2018barbed, stinging words\u2019. \u523a could mean \u2018to goad\u2019. \u523a could also mean \u2018to murder\u2019.",
    "\u2018But that\u2019s just it,\u2019 said Letty. \u2018They\u2019ve held back because they thought they could starve you out. They don\u2019t want you dead. Believe it or not, they don\u2019t like shooting at scholars. You\u2019re all very useful, you\u2019re right about that. But the country can\u2019t stand it anymore. You\u2019ve pushed them to the edge.\u2019",
    "\u2018Do you think Parliament cares what you destroy?\u2019 Letty demanded, impatient. \u2018Those men aren\u2019t bothered about what you\u2019re doing to Oxford, or to London. They laughed when the lights went dark, and they laughed when the bridge fell down. Those men want the city destroyed. They think it\u2019s grown too big and unwieldy already, that its dark, squalid slums are overriding all its civilized boroughs. And you know it\u2019s the poor who will suffer the most. The rich can ride out to the country and stay on their summer estates where they\u2019ll have clean air and clean water until spring.",
    "The poor will die in droves. Listen, you two. The people who run this country care more about the pride of the British Empire than they do mild inconveniences, and they\u2019ll let the city collapse before they bow to the demands of what they see as a handful of \u2013 of Babblers.\u2019.",
    "\u2018I know,\u2019 said Letty. \u2018It\u2019s what I grew up with. I know how deep it runs. Believe me on this. You have no idea how much they\u2019re willing to bleed for the sake of their pride. These men let Westminster Bridge fall. What else can you threaten them with?\u2019",
    "She blinked, and suddenly tears traced two thin, clear lines down her face. This was not an act; they knew Letty could not act. She was heartbroken, truly heartbroken. She loved them; Robin did not doubt it; at least she really believed that she loved them. She wanted them safe and sound, only her version of a successful resolution was to put them behind bars.",
    "\u2018They do have to be,\u2019 said Victoire. \u2018Because we\u2019ll never be British. How can you still not understand? That identity is foreclosed to us. We are foreign because this nation has marked us so, and as long as we\u2019re punished daily for our ties to our homelands, we might as well defend them. No, Letty, we can\u2019t maintain this fantasy. The only one who can do that is you.\u2019",
    "The truce was over; the walls were up; they had reminded her why she\u2019d abandoned them, which was that she could never really, properly, be one of them. And Letty, if she could not belong to a place, would rather tear the whole thing down.",
    "\u2018Please understand.\u2019 Letty\u2019s voice hardened. \u2018You gave them a headache. Well done you. But you are, in the end, expendable. All of you. Losing you would be a minor setback, but the imperial project involves more than a few scholars. And it will span more than a few decades. This nation is trying to achieve what no other civilization has done throughout history, and if mowing you down means a temporary delay, then they\u2019ll do it. They\u2019ll train new translators.\u2019",
    "Letty scoffed. \u2018Of course they will. We knew very well what they were up to, didn\u2019t we? They told us on the very first day. And we still loved it here. They\u2019ll always be able to find new translators. They\u2019ll relearn what they lost. And they\u2019ll just keep going, because no one else will be there to stop them.\u2019 She seized Robin\u2019s hand. The gesture was so sudden, so shocking that he didn\u2019t have time to pull away. Her skin was icy cold, her grip so strong he was afraid she might snap his fingers off. \u2018You can\u2019t change things if you\u2019re dead, Birdie.\u2019",
    "\u2018This isn\u2019t worth it,\u2019 Letty continued. \u2018All those bodies in the streets \u2013 and for what? To make a point? Ideological righteousness is well and fine, but by God, Robin, you\u2019re letting people die for a cause you must know is bound to fail. And you will fail,\u2019 she continued, relentlessly. \u2018You don\u2019t have the numbers. You don\u2019t have the public support, you don\u2019t have the votes, and you don\u2019t have the momentum. You don\u2019t understand how determined the Empire is to reclaim its silver. You think you\u2019re prepared to make sacrifices? They will do anything it takes to smoke you out.",
    "\u2018Tell me \u2013 if you\u2019d just seen your friends die, if you had a gun pointed at your head, wouldn\u2019t you go back to work? They\u2019ve already arrested Chakravarti, you know. They\u2019ll torture him until he cooperates. Go on, tell me \u2013 when push comes to shove, how many people in this tower are going to stick to their principles?\u2019",
    "\u2018I ask again. How long do you think that\u2019ll last? They haven\u2019t yet lost one of their own. How do you think they\u2019ll feel when the first body of your revolution hits the floor? When there\u2019s a gun to their temple?\u2019",
    "\u2018I\u2019m trying to save you,\u2019 Letty insisted. \u2018I\u2019m your last shot at salvation. Surrender now, come out peacefully, and cooperate with restoration. You won\u2019t be in prison for long. They need you, you said it yourself \u2013 you\u2019ll be back at Babel in no time, doing the work you always dreamed of. It\u2019s the best offer you\u2019ll get. That\u2019s all I came here to say. Take it, or you\u2019ll die.\u2019",
    "\u2018Then call a meeting.\u2019 Letty\u2019s lip curled. \u2018Poll the room, get a consensus with whatever little form of democracy you\u2019ve got running here.\u2019 She placed the white flag down on a table. \u2018But have an answer for us by dawn.\u2019",
    "She froze. She looked like a statue; under the moonlight, her cheeks shone a pale, marble white. This was how he should always have seen her, he thought. Cold. Bloodless. Devoid of anything that made her a living, breathing, loving, hurting human being.",
    "He knew what. They both knew; there was no question. But Robin wanted to give it a name, wanted to make sure Letty knew what he knew, wanted to pull the memory fresh between them, sharp and vicious, because he could see the pain it brought to Letty\u2019s eyes and because she deserved it.",
    "\u2018I didn\u2019t,\u2019 she said; and Robin could tell from the way she narrowed her eyes and drawled her words, punctuating them just so, like daggers, what was going to come next. His own words, thrown back in his face. \u2018I didn\u2019t think at all. I panicked. And then I killed him.\u2019",
    "An awful weight hung between them. Robin knew his answer, only not how to utter it. Victoire knew everything in his heart except this. It was the one thing he\u2019d concealed from her \u2013 in part because he did not want to make her share this burden, and in part because he was afraid of how she might respond.",
    "Victoire went very still then. Robin knew what she was imagining. The shrill, vibrating bar in Professor Playfair\u2019s hands, screaming as if in pain, shattering into a thousand sharp, glinting pieces. Multiply that over and over. Instead of a bar, imagine a tower. Imagine a country.",
    "\u2018It\u2019s a chain reaction,\u2019 he whispered. \u2018It\u2019ll finish the job on its own. Remember? Playfair showed us how it\u2019s done. If it so much as touches another bar, the effect transmits across the metal. It doesn\u2019t stop, it just keeps going, until it renders all the silver unusable.\u2019",
    "How much silver lined the walls of Babel? When this was over, all those bars would be worthless. Then the cooperation of the translators wouldn\u2019t matter. Their facilities would be gone. Their library, gone. The Grammaticas, gone. Their resonance rods, their silver, useless, gone.",
    "But that was just it, Robin thought. How did he explain the weight crushing his chest, the constant inability to breathe? \u2018I think \u2013 ever since Ramy and Griffin \u2013 no, ever since Canton, I . . .\u2019 He swallowed. \u2018I\u2019ve felt I didn\u2019t have the right.\u2019",
    "\u2018Don\u2019t you dare.\u2019 She raised a hand as if to slap him. \u2018Don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re just some fragile academic who can\u2019t handle the weight of the world now that you\u2019ve seen it \u2013 that\u2019s absolute tripe, Robin. You\u2019re not some foppish dandy who faints at the first mention of suffering. You know what those men are? They\u2019re cowards, romantics, idiots who never did a thing to change the world they found so upsetting, hiding away because they felt so guilty\u2014\u2019",
    "\u2018No, listen.\u2019 He gripped her hands. They were trembling. She tried to pull away, but he squeezed her fingers between his. He needed her with him. Needed to make her understand, before she hated him forever for abandoning her to the dark. \u2018He\u2019s right. You\u2019re right. I know it, I\u2019m trying to say it \u2013 he was right. I\u2019m so sorry. But I don\u2019t know how to go on.\u2019",
    "\u2018No, it\u2019s \u2013 Victoire, I can\u2019t.\u2019 He didn\u2019t want to cry; if he started crying, then all his words would disappear and he would never manage to say what he needed to. He ploughed through before his tears could catch up. \u2018I want to believe in the future we\u2019re fighting for, but it\u2019s not there, it\u2019s just not there, and I can\u2019t take things day by day when I\u2019m too horrified by the thought of tomorrow. I\u2019m underwater. And I\u2019ve been underwater for so long, and I wanted a way out, but couldn\u2019t find one that didn\u2019t feel like some \u2013 some great abdication of responsibility. But this \u2013 this is my way out.\u2019",
    "Victoire\u2019s gaze was fixed steadily on the window, at the black lawn outside, at the torchlit barricades. She cried, steadily and silently; the tears kept streaming down her cheeks and she kept wiping them away, pointlessly. He couldn\u2019t tell what she was thinking. This was the first time, since all this had started, that he couldn\u2019t read her heart.",
    "Robin had read it, in fact, in an abolitionist pamphlet he\u2019d picked up in London. He\u2019d found it striking; he still remembered it in detail. It described the story of an African man who, facing the prospects of capture and return to slavery, killed himself instead.* Robin had found it romantic and moving at the time, but now, seeing Victoire\u2019s expression, he realized it was anything but.",
    "\u2018We have to die to get their pity,\u2019 said Victoire. \u2018We have to die for them to find us noble. Our deaths are thus great acts of rebellion, a wretched lament that highlights their inhumanity. Our deaths become their battle cry. But I don\u2019t want to die, Robin.\u2019 Her throat hitched. \u2018I don\u2019t want to die. I don\u2019t want to be their Imoinda, their Oroonoko.* I don\u2019t want to be their tragic, lovely lacquer figure. I want to live.\u2019",
    "\u2018I want to live,\u2019 she repeated, \u2018and live, and thrive, and survive them. I want a future. I don\u2019t think death is a reprieve. I think it\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s just the end. It forecloses everything \u2013 a future where I might be happy, and free. And it\u2019s not about being brave. It\u2019s about wanting another chance. Even if all I did was run away, even if I never lifted a finger to help anyone else as long as I lived \u2013 at least I would get to be happy. At least the world might be all right, just for a day, just for me. Is that selfish?\u2019",
    "Her shoulders crumpled. Robin held her tight against him. What an anchor she was, he thought, an anchor he did not deserve. She was his rock, his light, the sole presence that had kept him going. And he wished, he wished, that was enough for him to hold on to.",
    "She was the first to speak. The rest of them stared at Robin and Victoire in varying states of disbelief, and even Professor Craft seemed like she was still wrapping her mind around the idea as she spoke its implications out loud. \u2018That\u2019s decades \u2013 centuries \u2013 of research, that\u2019s everything, buried \u2013 lost \u2013 oh, but who knows how many . . .\u2019 She trailed off.",
    "\u2018They won\u2019t go to war. They won\u2019t be able to. Silver powers the gunships, you see. Silver feeds the Navy. For months after this, perhaps years, they\u2019ll no longer be the strongest nation in the world. And what happens next is anyone\u2019s guess.\u2019",
    "The future would be fluid. It was just as Griffin had predicted. One individual choice, made at just the right time. This was how they defied momentum. This was how they altered the tracks of history.",
    "\u2018They\u2019re storming us at dawn,\u2019 said Robin. \u2018They\u2019ll shoot a few of us to make an example, and then hold the rest of us at gunpoint until we start repairing the damage. They\u2019ll put us in chains, and they\u2019ll put us to work.\u2019",
    "But you can\u2019t get out fast, Robin almost said before he stopped himself. The rejoinder was obvious. They couldn\u2019t get out fast, because they couldn\u2019t get out at all. A single incantation would not do. If they were not thorough, the tower might collapse partway, but its remains would be salvageable, easily repurposed. The only things they would have inflicted would be expense and frustration. They would have suffered for nothing.",
    "No; for this plan to work \u2013 to strike a blow against empire from which it could not recover \u2013 they had to stay, and say the words again and again, and activate as many nodes of destruction as they could.",
    "\u2018We won\u2019t need everyone,\u2019 he continued, desperate to fill the silence with words because, perhaps the more he spoke it, the less awful it sounded. \u2018I suppose a diversity of languages would be good, to amplify the effect \u2013 and of course, we\u2019ll want people standing in all corners of the tower, because . . .\u2019 His throat pulsed. \u2018But we don\u2019t need everyone.\u2019",
    "He saw them all making the same calculation then: the finality of death against the persecution, prison, and possible execution they would face on the outside. Surviving Babel did not necessarily mean survival. And he could see them asking themselves if they could come to terms, now, with their own deaths; if that would, in the end, be easier.",
    "\u2018No,\u2019 said Robin. But that was all he could say. He didn\u2019t understand his heart himself. He felt resolved, but perhaps that was only the adrenaline; perhaps his fear and hesitation were only pushed temporarily behind a flimsy wall, which would shatter upon closer examination. \u2018No, I\u2019m not, I . . . just \u2013 I\u2019m ready. But we won\u2019t need everyone.\u2019",
    "\u2018There is. Abel\u2019s men can ferry you out of the city, they\u2019ve promised; they\u2019re waiting for us. But you\u2019ll have to go as soon as you can. And then you\u2019ll have to run. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll ever be able to stop running.\u2019",
    "\u2018There are if you work for them,\u2019 said Robin. \u2018If you help them restore things back to how they were. Letty made that offer, she wanted you to know. But you\u2019ll always be under their thumb. They\u2019ll never let you go. She intimated as much \u2013 they\u2019ll own you, and they\u2019ll make you feel grateful for it.\u2019",
    "And it was that simple, the determination of who fled and who died. Robin, Professor Craft, Meghana, Ibrahim, and Juliana on one side. Yusuf and Victoire on the other. No one pleaded or begged, and no one changed their minds.",
    "\u2018It\u2019s a written record,\u2019 said Robin. \u2018Of everything that\u2019s happened in this tower. What we stood for. There\u2019s a second copy, but in case it gets lost \u2013 I know you\u2019ll find some way to get this out there. Print it all over England. Tell them what we did. Make them remember us.\u2019 Abel looked like he wanted to argue, but Robin shook his head. \u2018Please, my mind\u2019s made up, and there\u2019s not much time. I can\u2019t explain this, and I think it\u2019s best if you don\u2019t ask.\u2019",
    "\u2018We\u2019re going to try.\u2019 Robin\u2019s chest felt very tight. He was so exhausted; he wanted to curl up on the ground and go to sleep. He wanted this to be over. \u2018But I can\u2019t tell you more tonight. I just need you to go.\u2019",
    "\u2018Think nothing of it.\u2019 Abel wrapped his other hand over Robin\u2019s. His grip was so warm, solid. Robin felt a catch in his throat; he was grateful that Abel was making this easy, that he hadn\u2019t forced him to justify himself. He had to go swiftly, resolute to the very end.",
    "They spent the hours before dawn arranging hundreds of silver bars into pyramids at vulnerable points around the tower \u2013 around the base supports, beneath the windows, along the walls and bookshelves, and in veritable pyramids around the Grammaticas. They could not predict the scope, the scale, of the destruction, but they would prepare for it as well as they could, would make it near impossible to salvage any material from the remains.",
    "Victoire and Yusuf left an hour after midnight. Their farewells were brief, constrained. It was an impossible parting; there was too much and yet nothing to say, and there was a sense that everyone was holding back for fear of opening the floodgates. If they said too little, they would regret it forever. If they said too much, they\u2019d never bring themselves to part.",
    "They clung to each other for a long time, long enough that at last, once everyone had left to give them privacy, they were the only two standing in the lobby. Finally she stepped back, glanced round, eyes darting back and forth as if she was unsure whether to speak.",
    "\u2018I\u2019m just terrified that we\u2019ll make this grand statement.\u2019 She lifted her hands, let them fall. \u2018And they\u2019ll see it only as a temporary setback, something to recover from. That they\u2019ll never understand what we meant.\u2019",
    "She nodded, gave him one last, tight squeeze, and then darted out the door to the green where Yusuf and Abel\u2019s men were waiting. One last wave \u2013 Victoire\u2019s stricken expression under the moonlight \u2013 and then they were gone.",
    "How did one make peace with one\u2019s own death? According to the accounts of the Crito, the Phaedo, and the Apology, Socrates went to his death without distress, with such preternatural calm that he refused multiple entreaties to escape. In fact, he\u2019d been so cheerfully blas\u00e9, so convinced that dying was the just thing to do, that he beat his friends over their heads with his reasoning, in that insufferably righteous way of his, even as they burst into tears. Robin had been so struck, upon his first foray into the Greek texts, by Socrates\u2019s utter indifference to his end.",
    "And surely it was better, easier to die with such good cheer; no doubts, no fears, one\u2019s heart at rest. He could, in theory, believe it. Often, he had thought of death as a reprieve. He had not stopped dreaming of it since the day Letty shot Ramy. He entertained himself with ideas of heaven as paradise, of green hills and brilliant skies where he and Ramy could sit and talk and watch an eternal sunset. But such fantasies did not comfort him so much as the idea that all death meant was nothingness, that everything would just stop: the pain, the anguish, the awful, suffocating grief.",
    "They wound up sitting on the floor in the lobby, taking comfort in the silence of the group, listening to each other breathe. Professor Craft tried, haltingly, to comfort them, surveying her memory for ancient words on this most human of dilemmas. She spoke to them of Seneca\u2019s Troades, of Lucan\u2019s Vulteius, of the martyrdom of Cato and Socrates. She quoted to them Cicero, Horace, and Pliny the Elder. Death is nature\u2019s greatest good. Death is a better state. Death frees the immortal soul. Death is transcendence. Death is an act of bravery, a glorious act of defiance.",
    "None of it really sank in; none of it moved them, for theorizing about death never could. Words and thoughts always ran up against the immovable limit of the imminent, permanent ending. Still, her voice, steady and unflinching, was a comfort; they let it wash over their ears, lulling them in these final hours.",
    "They would not face their ends together. Each man and woman to their station \u2013 to the pyramids of silver distributed on different floors and different wings across the building, positioned thus to reduce the chances that any part of the tower might remain intact. When the walls tumbled down upon them, they would be alone, and this was why, as the moment drew near, it felt so impossible to part.",
    "They all felt the same, a desperate hope for some chance of escape. In these last moments, the seconds weren\u2019t enough. In theory this decision they\u2019d made was something beautiful. In theory they would be martyrs, heroes, the ones who\u2019d pushed history off its path. But none of that was a comfort. In the moment, all that mattered was that death was painful and frightening and permanent, and none of them wanted to die.",
    "Robin remained in the centre of the lobby beneath the broken chandelier, surrounded by eight pyramids of silver bars as tall as he stood. He took a deep breath, watching the second hand tick across the clock above the door.",
    "Oxford\u2019s bell towers had long gone mute. As the minute drew near, the only indication of the time was the synchronized ticking of the grandfather clocks, all positioned in the same place on every floor. They\u2019d chosen six o\u2019clock on the dot; an arbitrary time, but they needed a final moment, an immovable fact on which to fix their will.",
    "He loosed a shaky breath. His thoughts flew about, casting desperately for anything to think about that was not this. He landed not on coherent memories but on hyperspecific details \u2013 the salty weight of the air at sea, the length of Victoire\u2019s eyelashes, the hitch in Ramy\u2019s voice just before he burst out into full-bellied laughter. He clung to them, lingered there as long as he could, refused to let his mind go anywhere else.",
    "The bitter taste of ale, and the biting sting of Griffin\u2019s laughter. The sour stink of opium. Dinner at the Old Library; fragrant curry and the burnt bottoms of oversalted potatoes. Laughter, loud and desperate and hysterical.",
    "The sharp ring echoed through the room, a siren\u2019s screech, reverberating through his bones. A death rattle, resounding all the way up and down the tower, for everyone had carried out their duty; no one had balked.",
    "Robin exhaled, trembling. No space for hesitation. No time for fear. He moved his hand to the bars in the next pile and whispered again. \u2018F\u0101ny\u00ec. Translate.\u2019 Again. \u2018F\u0101ny\u00ec. Translate.\u2019 And again. \u2018F\u0101ny\u00ec. Translate.\u2019",
    "He thought he\u2019d be fixated on the pain; on how it might feel when eight thousand tons of rubble collapsed on him at once; on whether death might be instant, or whether it might come in horribly small increments when his hands and limbs were crushed, when his lungs struggled to expand in an ever-tinier space.",
    "But what struck him most just then was the beauty. The bars were singing, shaking; trying, he thought, to express some unutterable truth about themselves, which was that translation was impossible, that the realm of pure meaning they captured and manifested would and could not ever be known, that the enterprise of this tower had been impossible from inception.",
    "For how could there ever be an Adamic language? The thought now made him laugh. There was no innate, perfectly comprehensible language; there was no candidate, not English, not French, that could bully and absorb enough to become one. Language was just difference. A thousand different ways of seeing, of moving through the world. No; a thousand worlds within one. And translation \u2013 a necessary endeavour, however futile, to move between them.",
    "He went back to his first morning in Oxford: climbing a sunny hill with Ramy, picnic basket in hand. Elderflower cordial. Warm brioche, sharp cheese, a chocolate tart for dessert. The air that day smelled like a promise, all of Oxford shone like an illumination, and he was falling in love.",
    "\u2018Because you\u2019re a good translator.\u2019 Ramy leaned back on his elbows. \u2018That\u2019s just what translation is, I think. That\u2019s all speaking is. Listening to the other and trying to see past your own biases to glimpse what they\u2019re trying to say. Showing yourself to the world, and hoping someone else understands.\u2019",
    "The ceiling was starting to crumble; first streams of pebbles, then whole chunks of marble, exposing planks, breaking beams. The shelves collapsed. Sunlight streaked the room where before there had been no windows. Robin looked up and saw Babel, falling in and upon him, and beyond that, the sky before dawn.",
    "But he\u2019d waited for death to come before. He remembered this now - he knew death. Not so abruptly, no, not so violently. But the memory of waiting to fade was still locked in his bones; memories of a stale, hot room, of paralysis, of dreaming about the end. He remembered the stillness. The peace. As the windows smashed in, Robin shut his eyes and imagined his mother\u2019s face.",
    "The key, she has learned, is refusing to look back. Even as she races north on horseback through the Cotswolds, head bent against the whipping branches, some part of her wants to be in the tower, with her friends, feeling the walls come down around them. If they must die, she wants them to be buried together.",
    "But survival demands severing the cord. Survival demands she look only to the future. Who knows what will happen now? What happened in Oxford today is unthinkable, its ramifications unimaginable. There is no historical precedent for this. The juncture is shot. History, for once, is fluid.",
    "But Victoire is familiar with the unthinkable. The liberation of her motherland was unthinkable even as it happened, for no one in France or England, not even the most radical proponents of universal freedom, believed that slaves \u2013 creatures they never thought fell under their categories of rational, rights-holding, enlightened men \u2013 would demand their own liberation.",
    "Two months after news broke of the August 1791 uprising, Jean Pierre Brissot, himself a founding member of the Amis des Noirs, announced to the French Assembly that this news must be false, for as anyone knew, slaves were simply incapable of such rapid, coordinated, defiant action. A year into the revolution, many still believed that soon the unrest would be quelled, that things would go back to normal, for normal meant white dominance over Blacks..",
    "She was born in Haiti, Ayiti, in 1820, the same year that King Henry Christophe, fearing a coup, took his own life. His wife and daughters fled to the home of an English benefactor in Suffolk. Victoire\u2019s mother, a maid of the exiled queen, went with them. She referred to this always as their great flight and, once she set foot in Paris, refused ever to think again of Haiti as home.",
    "Victoire\u2019s understanding of Haitian history is of curses in the night; of a magnificent palace named Sans Souci, home to the first Black king in the New World; of men with guns; of vague political disagreements she does not understand that, somehow, uprooted her life and sent her across the Atlantic. As a child she knew her motherland as a place of violence and barbaric power struggles, for that is how they spoke of it in France, and that was what her exiled mother chose to believe.",
    "But her mother did not survive France. Victoire never learned how her mother, a free-born woman, was sent from Suffolk to work in the household of a retired Parisian academic, Professor Emile Desjardins. She does not know what promises her mother\u2019s friends made her, whether or not money changed hands. She knows only that in Paris, at the Desjardins estate, they were not allowed to leave \u2013 for here, forms of slavery still existed, as they did all over the world; a twilight condition, the rules unwritten but implied. And when her mother fell ill, the Desjardinses did not send for a doctor.",
    "Then they locked Victoire in a cupboard and did not let her out, for fear the illness would catch. But the contagion took the rest of the household regardless, and once again the doctors were powerless to do anything but watch it run its course.",
    "Victoire survived. Professor Desjardins\u2019s wife survived. His daughters survived. The professor himself died, and with him, Victoire\u2019s only connection to the people who purported to love her mother, and had yet somehow sold her away.",
    "The house fell into disrepair. Madame Desjardins, a tight-faced blonde woman, kept bad accounts and spent prodigiously. Money was tight. They fired the maid \u2013 why keep one, they argued, when they had Victoire? Overnight Victoire became responsible for dozens of tasks: keeping the fire, polishing the silver, dusting the rooms, serving the tea. But these were not tasks she\u2019d been trained to fulfil. She\u2019d been raised to read and compose and interpret, not manage a household, and for this they scolded and beat her.",
    "She found no comfort from Madame Desjardins\u2019s two little daughters, who took great delight in announcing to houseguests that Victoire was an orphan they\u2019d rescued from Africa. \u2018From Zanzibar,\u2019 they would sing in unison. \u2018Zaaanzibar!\u2019",
    "It was not so bad, they told her, compared with her native Haiti, which was overrun with crime, which was being driven to poverty and anarchy by an incompetent and illegitimate regime. You are lucky, they said, to be here with us, where things are safe, and civilized.",
    "She might have run away, but Professor and Madame Desjardins had kept her so sheltered, so isolated from the world outside that she had no idea she had the legal right to be free. Victoire had grown up in the great contradiction of France, whose citizens in 1789 had issued a declaration of the rights of man but had not abolished slavery, and had preserved the right to property including chattel.",
    "Liberation was a string of coincidences, of ingenuity, resourcefulness, and luck. Victoire went through Professor Desjardins\u2019s letters, looking for a deed, some proof that he did own her and her mother. She never found it. But she did learn about a place named the Royal Institute of Translation, a place he\u2019d trained at in his youth, a place he\u2019d written to about her, in fact. He\u2019d told them about the brilliant little girl in his household, about her prodigious memory and talent for Greek and Latin. He\u2019d intended to show her around Europe on tour.",
    "And so she created the conditions of her own freedom. When Professor Desjardins\u2019s friends at Oxford finally wrote back, expressing that they would be very happy to have the talented Miss Desgraves at the Institute, and that they would pay the way, it felt like such an escape.",
    "But the true liberation of Victoire Desgraves did not happen until she met Anthony Ribben. It was not until her induction to the Hermes Society that she learned to call herself Haitian at all. She learned to take pride in her Krey\u00f2l, patchy, half-remembered, barely distinguishable from her French. (Madame Desjardins used to slap her whenever she spoke in Krey\u00f2l. \u2018Shut up,\u2019 she would say, \u2018I told you, you must speak French, the Frenchman\u2019s French.\u2019) She also learned that to much of the rest of the world, the Haitian Revolution was not a failed experiment but a beacon of hope.",
    "She learned revolution is, in fact, always unimaginable. It shatters the world you know. The future is unwritten, brimming with potential. The colonizers have no idea what is coming, and that makes them panic. It terrifies them.",
    "She\u2019s not sure where she\u2019s headed now. She has some envelopes in her coat pocket: parting words of advice from Anthony and the code names of several contacts. Friends in Mauritius, in the Seychelles, and in Paris. Perhaps one day she\u2019ll head back to France, but she\u2019s not quite ready yet. She knows there\u2019s a base in Ireland, though at the moment she\u2019d quite like just to be off the continent. Perhaps one day she\u2019ll go home and see, with her own eyes, the historical impossibility of free Haiti.",
    "Right now she\u2019s boarding a ship to America, where people like her are still not free, because it was the first vessel that she could book passage on, and because she needed to get out of England as quickly as she could..",
    "She has the letter from Griffin that Robin never opened. Meanwhile she\u2019s read it so many times she\u2019s memorized it. She knows three names \u2013 Martlet, Oriel, and Rook. She can see in her mind\u2019s eye the final sentence, scrawled before the signatures like an afterthought: We\u2019re not the only ones.",
    "She doesn\u2019t know who these three are. She doesn\u2019t know what this sentence means. She\u2019ll find out, one day, and the truth will dazzle and horrify her. But for now they are only lovely syllables that signify all sorts of possibilities, and possibilities \u2013 hope \u2013 are the only things she can cling to now.",
    "She has silver lining her pockets, silver in the inseams of her dress, so much silver on her person that she feels stiff and heavy when she moves. Her eyes are swollen from tears, her throat sore with stifled sobs. She has the faces of her dead friends engraved in her memory. She keeps imagining their last moments: their terror, their pain as the walls came crumbling down around them.",
    "She does not, will not let herself think of her friends as they were, alive and happy. Not Ramy, torn down in his prime; not Robin, who brought down a tower upon himself because he couldn\u2019t think of a way to keep on living. Not even Letty, who remains alive; who, if she knows Victoire lives too, will hunt her to the ends of the earth.",
    "She won\u2019t let herself grieve that friendship, as true and terrible and abusive as it was. There will come a time for grief. There will come many nights on the voyage when the sadness is so great it threatens to tear her apart; when she regrets her decision to live; when she curses Robin for placing this burden on her, because he was right: he was not being brave, he was not choosing sacrifice. Death is seductive. Victoire resists.",
    "She has no illusions about what she will encounter. She knows she will face immeasurable cruelty. She knows her greatest obstacle will be cold indifference, born of a bone-deep investment in an economic system that privileges some and crushes others.",
    "Anthony called victory an inevitability. Anthony believed the material contradictions of England would tear it apart, that their movement would succeed because the revels of the Empire were simply unsustainable. This, he argued, was why they had a chance.",
    "Victory is not assured. Victory may be in the portents, but it must be urged there by violence, by suffering, by martyrs, by blood. Victory is wrought by ingenuity, persistence, and sacrifice. Victory is a game of inches, of historical contingencies where everything goes right because they have made it go right.",
    "She cannot know what shape that struggle will take. There are so many battles to be fought, so many fights on so many fronts \u2013 in India, in China, in the Americas \u2013 all linked together by the same drive to exploit that which is not white and English. She knows only that she will be in it at every unpredictable turn, will fight until her dying breath.",
    "Babel is about infinite worlds of languages, cultures, and histories \u2013 many of which I do not know \u2013 and its writing would not have been possible without the friends who shared their knowledge with me. Many, many thanks are in order:",
    "First, to Peng Shepherd, Ehigbor Shultz, Farah Naz Rishi, Sarah Mughal, and Nathalie Gedeon for helping me ensure that Robin, Ramy, and Victoire were written with detail and compassion. To Caroline Mann and Allison Resnick for their Classics expertise; to Sarah Forssman, Saoudia Ganiou, and De\u2019Andre Ferreira for their help with translations; and to my dear professors at Yale \u2013 in particular Jing Tsu, Lisa Lowe, and Denise Ho \u2013 for shaping my thinking about coloniality, post-coloniality, and the bearing of language on power.",

    "Thank you to Julius Bright-Ross, Taylor Vandick, Katie O\u2019Nell, and the Vaults & Garden cafe, who made those strange, sad months in Oxford bearable. And thank you to the New Haven homies \u2013 Tochi Onyebuchi, Akanksha Shah, and James Jensen \u2013 for the pizzas and the laughs. All hail the Great Egg.",
    "Thank you to Bennett, who was the best company I could have asked for during that long, lonely, terrible year in which Babel came together, and whose counsel shaped so many details of this story. He would like everyone to know that he named the book, as well as the Hermes Society, for while I have a sense for the literary, he has a sense for the awesome.",

    "* In Book IV, Chapter VII of The Wealth of Nations, Adam Smith argues against colonialism on the grounds that the defence of colonies is a drain on resources, and that the economic gains of the monopolistic colonial trade are an illusion. He writes: \u2018Great Britain derives nothing but loss from the dominion which she assumes over her colonies.\u2019 This view was not widely shared at the time.",
    "* As Robin\u2019s family had only recently migrated south, he had grown up speaking both Mandarin and Cantonese. But his Cantonese, Professor Lovell informed him, could now be forgotten. Mandarin was the language of the Qing imperial court in Peking, the language of officials and scholars, and therefore the only dialect that mattered.",
    "This view is a side effect of the British Academy\u2019s path dependency on scant previous Western research. Matteo Ricci\u2019s Portuguese-Chinese dictionary was of the Mandarin dialect he learned at the Ming court; Francisco Varo, Joseph Pr\u00e9mare, and Robert Morrison\u2019s Chinese dictionaries were also of Mandarin. Britain\u2019s Sinologists of that era, then, were far more focused on Mandarin than on other dialects. And so Robin was asked to forget his preferred native tongue.",
    "* This was to be the last Marryat title Robin ever read. It was just as well. Frederick Marryat\u2019s novels, though full of the high seas adventuring and valour that endeared them to young English boys, also portrayed Black people as happy, satisfied slaves and American Indians as either noble savages or dissolute drunks. Chinese and Indians he described as \u2018races of inferior stature and effeminate in person\u2019.",
    "* As the weekly papers recorded the climbing death counts, Robin asked Mrs Piper why the doctors could not simply go around healing the sick with silver, as Professor Lovell had done to him. \u2018Silver is expensive,\u2019 responded Mrs Piper, and that was the last they ever spoke of it.",
    "* Indeed, in the wake of Haiti\u2019s liberation, the British began toying with the idea of importing labourers of other races, such as the Chinese (\u2018a sober, patient, industrious people\u2019), as a possible alternative to African slave labour. The Fortitude experiment of 1806 attempted to establish a colony of two hundred Chinese labourers in Trinidad to create a \u2018barrier between us and the Negroes\u2019. The colony failed, and most labourers soon returned to their native China.",
    "* There had once been a boy named Henry Little who\u2019d visited Hampstead with his father, one of Professor Lovell\u2019s colleagues in the Royal Asiatic Society. Robin tried to engage him in conversation about scones, which he thought as good an opening salvo as any, but Henry Little merely reached out and stretched Robin\u2019s eyelids out so hard that Robin, startled, kicked him in the shin. Robin was banished to his room, and Henry Little to the garden; Professor Lovell had not invited his colleagues to bring their children over since then.",
    "* This was true. University College had produced, among others, a Chief Justice of Bengal (Sir Robert Chambers), a Chief Justice of Bombay (Sir Edward West), and a Chief Justice of Calcutta (Sir William Jones). All were white men.",
    "* \u7121 (w\u00fa) means \u2018negative, not, without\u2019; \u5f62 (x\u00edng) means \u2018appearance, form, shape\u2019. \u4e94\u884c means not just invisible, but intangible. To illustrate: the poet Zhang Shunmin of the Northern Song dynasty wrote once that \u2018\u8a69\u662f\u7121\u5f62\u7684\u756b, \u756b\u662f\u6709\u5f62\u8a69\u2019; that poems were incorporeal (w\u00fax\u00edng) paintings, and paintings were corporeal poems.",
    "* Sarah Stickney Ellis, a well-known author, published several books (including The Wives of England, The Mothers of England, and The Daughters of England) arguing that women had a moral imperative to improve society through domestic propriety and virtuous conduct. Robin had no strong opinion on the matter; he\u2019d picked up her work by accident.",
    "* This is, frankly, quite a generous description of the Legal Department. One could also argue that the business of translators in Legal was manipulating language to create favourable terms for European parties. One example is the alleged sale of land by King Paspehay to the English in Virginia \u2018for copper\u2019, despite the obvious difficulty of translating precisely the notions of European kingship or land as property into Algonquin languages.",
    "* A good amount of foundational Western scholarship on Sanskrit was done by German Romantics such as Herder, Schlegel, and Bopp. Not all of their monographs had been translated into English \u2013 at least, not well \u2013 and so most students studying Sanskrit at Babel were also required to learn German.",
    "* This is true. Mathematics is not divorced from culture. Take counting systems \u2013 not all languages use base ten. Or geometry \u2013 Euclidean geometry assumes a conception of space not shared by all. One of the greatest intellectual shifts in history involves the transition from Roman numerals to the more elegant Arabic numerals, whose place-value notation and concept of zero, signifying nothing, made possible new forms of mental arithmetic.",
    "* The boys stayed out of this one. Privately, Ramy thought Letty had a fair point that as a woman, she was entitled to inherit none of the Price estate to begin with. Robin thought it was a bit rich for her to call herself \u2018impoverished\u2019 when they were all receiving stipends sizable enough that they could dine out whenever they felt like it.",
    "* These receptions were entertaining at first, but quickly grew tiresome when it became apparent that Babel scholars were there less as distinguished guests and more as zoo animals on display, expected to dance and perform for wealthy donors. Robin, Victoire, and Ramy were always treated as national representatives of the countries they appeared to hail from.",
    "Robin had to put up with excruciating small talk about Chinese botanical gardens and lacquerware; Ramy was expected to elaborate on the inner workings of the \u2018Hindu race\u2019, whatever that meant; and Victoire, bizarrely, was always being asked for speculation advice in the Cape..",
    "* Through Colin Thornhill and the Sharp brothers, Robin became aware of various \u2018sets\u2019 of people one might run with, which included \u2018fast men\u2019, \u2018slow men\u2019, \u2018reading men\u2019, \u2018gentlemen\u2019, \u2018cads\u2019, \u2018sinners\u2019, \u2018smilers\u2019, and \u2018saints\u2019. He thought perhaps he qualified as a \u2018reading man\u2019. He hoped he was not a \u2018cad\u2019.",
    "* Many romantic Univ undergraduates fancied themselves successors to Percy Bysshe Shelley, who rarely attended lectures, was expelled for refusing to admit authorship of a pamphlet titled \u2018The Necessity of Atheism\u2019, married a nice girl named Mary, and later drowned in a violent storm off the Gulf of Larici.",
    "* Robin, despite his general dislike of Shelley, had still read his thoughts on translation, which he grudgingly respected: \u2018Hence the vanity of translation; it were as wise to cast a violet into a crucible that you might discover the formal principle of its colour and odour, as seek to transfuse from one language into another the creations of a poet. The plant must spring again from its seed, or it will bear no flower \u2013 and this is the burthen of the curse of Babel.\u2019",
    "* Karl Wilhelm von Humboldt is perhaps most famous for writing in 1836 \u2018On the Structural Difference of Human Languages and Its Influence on the Intellectual Development of the Human Race\u2019, in which he argues, among other things, that a culture\u2019s language is deeply tied to the mental capacities and characteristics of those who speak it, which explains why Latin and Greek are better suited for sophisticated intellectual reasoning than, say, Arabic.",
    "* The military applications of this match-pair were really not as useful as Professor Playfair made them sound. It was impossible to specify which pieces of knowledge one wanted to remove, and often the match-pair only caused enemy soldiers to forget how to lace their boots, or how to speak the fragmented English they knew. The Duke of Wellington was not impressed.",
    "* In the late eighteenth century, there had been a brief craze of the silver-working potential of created languages such as the abbess Hildegard of Bingen\u2019s mystical Lingua Ignota, which had a glossary of over a thousand words; John Wilkins\u2019s language of truth, which involved an elaborate classification scheme for every known thing in the universe; and Sir Thomas Urquhart of Cromarty\u2019s \u2018Universal Language\u2019, which attempted to reduce the world to a perfectly rational expression of arithmetic.",
    "* An understatement. A few short decades after Potos\u00ed\u2019s \u2018discovery\u2019 in 1545, the silver city had become a death trap for enslaved Africans and drafted indigenous labourers working amidst mercury vapour, foul water, and toxic waste. Spain\u2019s \u2018King of Mountains and Envy of Kings\u2019 was a pyramid built on bodies lost to disease, forced marches, malnutrition, overwork, and a poisoned environment.",
    "* Two weeks into Michaelmas several freshers at Balliol had rented several punting boats and, in their drunken revels, created a traffic jam in the middle of the Cherwell that piled up three barges and one houseboat, costing incalculable pounds in damages. As punishment, the university had suspended all races until next year.",
    "* It took a great deal of rigour and scrutiny to contribute anything to a Grammatica. Oxford was still smarting from the embarrassments dealt by a former visiting lecturer named George Psalmanazar, a Frenchman who, claiming to be from Formosa, passed off his pale skin by saying that Formosans lived underground. He had lectured and published on the Formosan languages for decades before he was exposed as a complete fraud.",
    "* Omar ibn Said was a West African Islamic scholar captured into slavery in 1807. When he wrote his autobiographical essay in 1831, he was still enslaved by American politician James Owen in North Carolina. He would remain enslaved for the rest of his life.",
    "* This was only the beginning of the multiple flaws of Schlegel\u2019s work. Islam he considered a \u2018dead empty Theism\u2019. He also assumed that Egyptians were descended from Indians, and argued Chinese and Hebrew were inferior to German and Sanskrit because they lacked inflection.",
    "* Many of Babel\u2019s customers were ready to believe that their silver-work made use of foreign languages, but not that their maintenance involved foreign-born scholars, and more than once Professor Chakravarti had had to enlist one of the white fourth years to accompany him and Robin on trips just to get them through the door.",
    "* The manuscript in question \u2013 named the Baresch Codex after the alchemist who brought it to public attention \u2013 is a vellum-bound codex of what appears to be magic, science, or botany. It is written in an alphabet combining some Latin symbols and wholly unfamiliar symbols; this alphabet employs no capitalization and no punctuation marks. The script appears closest to Latin, and indeed makes use of Latin abbreviations, but the manuscript\u2019s purpose and meaning have remained a mystery since its discovery.",
    "The manuscript was acquired by Babel in the mid-eighteenth century, and many Babel scholars since have failed to translate it; the alphabet used for resonance links takes inspiration from the manuscript\u2019s symbols but represents no progress in deciphering the original..",
    "* And even this exam ritual was rather tame compared to the way things were done in the late eighteenth century. Back then fourth years were subject to what was called the \u2018door test\u2019, in which recent examinees lined up to walk through the entrance the morning after grading finished. Those who had passed would step through the door with no trouble; those who had failed would be treated by the tower as trespassers, and suffer whatever violent punishment the current wards were designed to inflict.",
    "* Though many Babel graduates were happy to work in Literature or Legal, the silver-working exam had higher stakes for scholars of foreign origin, who found it difficult to find prestigious postings in departments other than the eighth floor, where their fluency in non-European languages was most valuable. Griffin, upon failing his silver-working test, had been offered a continuation track in Legal. But Professor Lovell had always expressed the belief that nothing except silver-working mattered, and that every other department was for unimaginative, untalented fools.",
    "* A trap as tricky as false friends is folk etymologies: incorrect etymologies assigned by popular belief to words that in fact had different origins. The word handiron, for instance, means a metal tool to support logs in a fireplace. One is tempted to assume its etymology involved the words hand and iron separately. But handiron is truly derived from the French andier, which became andire in English.",
    "* Gabriel Shire Tregear, a London-based print seller and flaming racist, issued a series of caricature prints known as \u2018Tregear\u2019s Black Jokes\u2019 in the 1830s which aimed to ridicule the presence of Black people in social situations where Tregear thought they did not belong.",
    "* In the mid-eighteenth century, Babel scholars were briefly seized by an astrology fad, and several state-of-the-art telescopes were ordered for the roof on behalf of scholars who thought they could derive useful match-pairs from the names of star signs. These efforts never yielded anything interesting, as astrology is fake, but the stargazing was pleasant.",
    "* As with all valuable and expensive things, there was a massive underground market for counterfeit and amateur silver bars. At New Cut, one could buy charms to Banish Rodents, to Cure Common Ailments, and to Attract Wealthy Young Gentlemen. Most were composed without a basic understanding of the principles of silver-working, and involved elaborate spells in made-up languages often in imitation of Oriental languages. Yet some were, occasionally, rather incisive applications of folk etymology.",
    "* In doing so, Babel and Morse greatly upset the inventors William Cooke and Charles Wheatstone, whose own telegraph machine had been installed on the Great Western Railway just two years prior. However, Cooke and Wheatstone\u2019s telegraph used moving needles to point to a preset board of symbols, which did not afford nearly the range of communication that Morse\u2019s simpler, click-based telegraph did.",
    "* A list of offences that Babel undergraduates had got away with in the past included public intoxication, brawling, cockfighting, and intentionally adding vulgarities to a recital of the Latin grace before dinner in hall.",
    "* Ramy was, though he did not know it, then at the centre of a debate between the Orientalists, including Sir Horace Wilson, who favoured teaching Sanskrit and Arabic to Indian students, and the Anglicists, including Mr Trevelyan, who believed Indian students of promise ought to be taught English.",
    "This debate would come down firmly on the side of the Anglicists, best represented by Lord Thomas Macaulay\u2019s infamous February 1835 \u2018Minute on Education\u2019: \u2018We must at present do our best to form a class who may be interpreters between us and the millions whom we govern \u2013 a class of persons Indian in blood and colour, but English in tastes, in opinions, in morals, and in intellect.\u2019",
    "* Wilson\u2019s election to this position had raised something of a controversy. He had been in heated competition with Reverend W.H. Mill for election, and Reverend Mill\u2019s supporters spread the rumour that Wilson had insufficient character for the job, as he had eight illegitimate children. Wilson\u2019s supporters defended him on the grounds that in fact, he had only two.",
    "* The proliferation of Britain\u2019s railways had happened very quickly after the invention of silver-powered steam engines. The thirty-five-mile Liverpool-to-Manchester line, built in 1830, was the first railway built for general use, and nearly seven thousand miles of track had been laid around England since. The line from Oxford to London would have been built much sooner, but Oxford\u2019s professors delayed it for nearly four years on the grounds that such easy access to the temptations of the capital would wreak moral havoc on the young, naive gentlemen left in their care.",
    "* Baynes ended up placing a cannon in front of the English Factory to keep the Chinese from seizing his wife, and it was all very exciting for a fortnight until the lady was at last peaceably persuaded to leave.",
    "* This society, founded in November 1834, was created with the goal of inducing the Qing Empire to become more open to Western traders and missionaries through deploying \u2018intellectual artillery\u2019. It was inspired by the London Society, which generously elevated the poor and dissuaded political radicalism through the gift of education.",
    "* Reverend G\u00fctzlaff indeed often went by the name Ai Han Zhe, which translates as \u2018One who loves the Chinese\u2019. This moniker was not ironic; G\u00fctzlaff really did see himself as the champion of the Chinese people, whom he referred to in correspondence as kind, friendly, open, and intellectually curious people who unfortunately happened to be under the \u2018thralldom of Satan\u2019. That he could reconcile this attitude with his support for the opium trade remains an interesting contradiction.",
    "Religion had always been a point of contention between the four of them. Though they were all mandated by the college to attend Sunday services, only Letty and Victoire did so willingly; Ramy, of course, resented every minute, and Robin had been raised by Professor Lovell to be a devout atheist. \u2018Christianity is barbaric,\u2019 Professor Lovell opined. \u2018It\u2019s all self-flagellation, professed repression, and bloody, superstitious rituals as dress-up for doing whatever one wants. Go to church, if they make you, but take it as a chance to practise your recitations under your breath.\u2019",
    "* Here Letty was referring to the establishment of humanitarian societies for the protection of Indigenous peoples in British territories, such as the evangelical authors of the 1837 \u2018Report of the Parliamentary Select Committee on Aboriginal Tribes\u2019, which, though recognizing British presence had been a \u2018source of many calamities to uncivilized nations\u2019, recommended the continued expansion of white settlement and spread of British missionaries in Australia and New Zealand in the name of a holy \u2018civilizing mission\u2019.",
    "The Aborigines, they argued, would not suffer so greatly if only they learned to dress, talk, and behave like proper Christians. The great contradiction, of course, is that there is no such thing as humane colonization. The contribution of Babel to such a mission, meanwhile, was to supply English teaching materials to missionary schools and to translate English property laws to peoples displaced by colonial settlement..",
    "* This is a great lie, and one that white Britons are happy to believe. Victoire\u2019s following argument notwithstanding, slavery continued in India under the East India Company for a long time after. Indeed, slavery in India was specifically exempt from the Slave Emancipation Act of 1833. Despite early abolitionists\u2019 belief that India under the EIC was a country of free labour, the EIC was complicit in, directly profited from, and in many cases encouraged a range of types of bondage, including forced plantation labour, domestic labour, and indentured servitude.",
    "But the British, after all, were astoundingly good at holding contradictions in their head. Sir William Jones, a virulent abolitionist, at the same time admitted of his own household, \u2018I have slaves that I rescued from death and misery, but consider them as servants.\u2019",
    "* The poor Germanists always lost to the Romance linguists in these verbal spars, for they had to deal with hearing the words of their own King Frederick II of Prussia thrown back at them. Frederick was so cowed by the literary dominance of French that he wrote in 1780 an essay, in French, criticizing his native German for sounding half-barbarous, unrefined, and unpleasing to the ear. He then proposed to improve the sound of German by adding -a as the final syllable to a great quantity of verbs to make them sound more Italian.",
    "* Gora \u2013 \u2018white, pale\u2019, in reference to skin colour. Sahib \u2013 a salutation of respect. Put together, with the right tone of sarcasm and vehemence, it means something else altogether. Let it not be forgotten that, though Jones professed a great love and admiration for Indian languages throughout his career, he initially turned his scholarly attentions to Sanskrit because he suspected indigenous translators of being dishonest and unreliable.",
    "1. A comparative analysis of the quantity of footnotes added to translations of European texts versus non-European texts. Non-European texts, Griffin found, tended to be loaded down with an astonishing amount of explanatory context, to the effect that the text was never read as a work on its own, but always through the guided lens of the (white, European) translator.",
    "* The Hermes Society also had connections with translation centres at universities in America, but these were even more repressive and dangerous than Oxford. For one, they were founded by slave owners, built and maintained with slave labour, and their endowments were sustained by the slave trade.",
    "For another, these American universities since their founding were preoccupied with the project of evangelizing, eradicating, and erasing Natives; the Indian College, founded 1655 at Harvard University, promised free tuition and housing to Native students who were required in turn to speak only in Latin and Greek, convert to Christianity, and either assimilate into white society or return to their villages to evangelize English culture and religion. A similar programme at the College of William and Mary was described by their president, Lyon G.",
    "* Thomas Love Peacock, essayist, poet, and friend of Percy Bysshe Shelley, had also enjoyed a long career in India as an official with the East India Company. He was, in that year, the Chief Examiner of Indian Correspondence.",
    "* This is not a quotation from the Book of Genesis, which recounts the scattering of languages at Babel in much tamer terms. It is rather from the Third Apocalypse of Baruch, falsely attributed to the scribe Baruch ben Neriah. Griffin, in a fit of disillusionment, had briefly pursued a project recounting various versions of the fall of Babel.",
    "* He would never know, for instance, that there was a time when Griffin, Sterling, Anthony, and Evie had thought of themselves as a cohort as eternally bonded as Robin\u2019s did; or that Griffin and Sterling had quarrelled once over Evie, bright and vibrant and brilliant and beautiful Evie, or that Griffin truly hadn\u2019t meant it when he\u2019d killed her. In his retellings of that night, Griffin made himself out to be a calm and deliberate murderer.",
    "But the truth was that, like Robin, he\u2019d acted without thinking, from anger, from fear, but not from malice; he did not even really believe it would work, for silver responded only sporadically to his command, and he didn\u2019t know what he\u2019d done until Evie was bleeding out on the floor. Nor would he ever know that Griffin, unlike Robin, had no cohort to lean on after his act, no one to help him absorb the shock of this violence.",
    "And so he\u2019d swallowed it, curled in around it, made it a part of himself \u2013 and while for others this might have been the first step on the road to madness, Griffin Lovell had instead whittled this capacity to kill into a sharp and necessary weapon..",
    "* This supplementary silver bar is one of the rare Old English\u2013to-English match-pairs, created by a Hermes scholar, John Fugues, who participated in a project in the 1780s where scholars locked themselves in a castle and spoke only Old English to each other for three months.",
    "(Such experiments have not been repeated since, though not for lack of funding; Babel was simply unable to find volunteers willing to undergo the same extreme isolation, compounded by the inability to properly express oneself to others.) The Old English b\u0113acen refers to audible signals, portents, and signs \u2013 instead of the rather flat English meaning, which just refers to a great signal of fire..",
    "* This loophole was, in fact, deliberate. In its early days, the tower viciously attacked entrants and escapees alike, but the wards were imprecise, and the number of wrongful maimings escalated until the city government insisted there had to be some sort of due process. Professor Playfair\u2019s response was to catch thieves only upon departure, when the incriminating evidence would be in their pockets or strewn across the cobblestones around them.",
    "* This decision had been a matter of fierce debate between Robin and Victoire. Robin had wanted to hold all the scholars hostage; Victoire, instead, made the compelling argument that several dozen scholars were much more likely to comply with being forced out of a building at gunpoint than being trapped in a basement for weeks on end, with nowhere to bathe, do their laundry, or shit.",
    "* The word strike, in relation to labour, originally had the connotation of submission. Ships would drop, or strike, their sails when surrendering to enemy forces or saluting their superiors. But when sailors in 1768 struck their sails in protest to demand better wages, they turned strike from an act of submission to a strategic act of violence; by withholding their labour, they proved they were in fact indispensable.",
    "* The verb \u092d\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0924\u094d\u0924\u0947 (bhintte) makes use of the Sanskrit root \u092d\u093f\u0926\u094d (bhid), which means \u2018to break, to pierce, to strike, or to destroy\u2019. \u092d\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0924\u094d\u0924\u0947 has a variety of meanings, including \u2018to fracture, to distract, to dissolve, and to disunite\u2019.",
    "* The tactics of revolt spread fast. The British textile workers picked up these techniques of barricade from the 1831 and 1834 Canut revolts by silk workers in Lyon. Those revolts had been brutally repressed \u2013 but, crucially, they did not hold the backbone of the entire nation hostage.",
    "* If this organizational competence strikes one as surprising, remember that both Babel and the British government made a great mistake in assuming all antisilver movements of the century were spontaneous riots carried out by uneducated, discontented lowlifes. For instance, the Luddites, so maligned as technology-fearing machine breakers, were a highly sophisticated insurrectionary movement, composed of small, well-disciplined groups who used disguises and watchwords, raised funds and gathered arms, terrorized their opponents, and carried out well-planned, targeted attacks.",
    "(And, while it is true the Luddite movement ultimately failed, it was only after Parliament had mobilized twelve thousand troops to put it down \u2013 more troops than had fought in the Peninsular War.) It was this level of training and professionalism that Abel\u2019s men brought to the Babel strike..",
    "* Barricade comes from the Spanish barrica, meaning \u2018barrel\u2019, the basic building block of the first barricades. Besides their historical significance, barrels made for good barricade material for several reasons: they were easy to transport, easy to fill with sand or rocks, and easy to stack in ways that left portholes for snipers stationed behind them.",
    "* Crucially, everything that ran on steam power was in trouble. Professor Lovell, it turned out, had made the majority of his fortune by turning steam power from a fussy and complicated technology to a reliable source of energy that powered nearly the whole of the British fleet. His great innovation had actually been quite simple: in Chinese, the character for vapour was \u6c14 (q\u00ec), which also bore connotations of spirit and energy. When installed on the engines devised by Richard Trevithick some decades earlier, it produced a shocking amount of energy at a fraction of the cost in coal.",
    "(Researchers in the 1830s had explored applications of this match-pair in aerial transportation, but they hadn\u2019t got very far as the balloons kept either exploding or shooting into the stratosphere.).",
    "This single invention, some argued, explained Britain\u2019s victory at Trafalgar. Now all of England ran on steam. Steam locomotives had displaced many horse-drawn vehicles; steam-engine ships had mostly displaced sails. But Britain had very few Chinese translators indeed, and, with the exception of Robin and Professor Chakravarti, all the other translators were, unhelpfully, dead or abroad.",
    "Without scheduled maintenance, steam power would not fail to work entirely, but it would lose its unique power; it\u2019s incredible efficiency that put British ships in a league beyond anything the American or Spanish fleets could achieve..",
    "* The Baresch alphabet used on the resonance rods, for instance, is not strictly necessary to their function; it was created by Babel scholars solely so that its proprietary resonance technology would remain inscrutable to outsiders. It is astounding, in truth, how much of academia\u2019s perceived resource scarcity is artificially constructed.",
    "* Abel brought them a running stream of gruesome updates. On the Cherwell, a houseboat collided with a transport barge when the navigation systems of both failed, causing a steaming pile-up in the middle of the river. Three people died, trapped in submerged cabins. Up in Jericho, a four-year-old child was crushed under the wheels of a carriage which ran amok. Out in Kensington, a seventeen-year-old girl and her lover were buried alive when the ruins of a church tower collapsed above them during a midnight tryst.",
    "* On a Wednesday, two carts collided, one of which was loaded with barrels of fine brandy. When the sweet fumes leaked out onto the street, a small crowd of bystanders rushed in to scoop up the brandy with their hands, and it was all good fun until a man with a lit pipe walked into the fray, turning the street into a conflagration of people, horses, and exploding barrels.",
    "* The papers always referred to the strikers as foreign; as Chinamen, Indians, Arabs, and Africans. (Never mind Professor Craft.) They were never Oxfordians, they were never Englishmen, they were travellers from abroad who had taken advantage of Oxford\u2019s good graces, and who now held the nation hostage. Babel had become synonymous with foreign, and this was very strange, because before this, the Royal Institute of Translation had always been regarded as a national treasure, a quintessentially English institution.",
    "But then England, and the English language, had always been more indebted to the poor, the lowly, and the foreign than it cared to admit. The word vernacular came from the Latin verna, meaning \u2018house slave\u2019; this emphasized the nativeness, the domesticity of the vernacular language. But the root verna also indicated the lowly origins of the language spoken by the powerful; the terms and phrases invented by slaves, labourers, beggars, and criminals \u2013 the vulgar cants, as it were \u2013 had infiltrated English until they became proper.",
    "And the English vernacular could not properly be called domestic either, because English etymology had roots all over the world. Almanacs and algebra came from Arabic; pyjamas from Sanskrit, ketchup from Chinese, and paddies from Malay. It was only when elite England\u2019s way of life was threatened that the true English, whoever they were, attempted to excise all that had made them..",
    "* But that was part of the genius of Babel. By keeping them isolated, by distracting them with coursework so that they never had the chance to form bonds outside their cohort, it had cut off all avenues towards meaningful solidarity, had made them believe for so long that they were the only ones caught in their particular web.",
    "* The Peterloo Massacre of 1819, the largest immediate effect of which was to provoke a government crackdown on radical organizing. The cavalry rushed a crowd agitating for parliamentary representation, crushing men, women, and children alike under their hooves. Eleven died.",
    "* In (the white Englishwoman) Aphra Behn\u2019s 1688 romantic novel Oroonoko, the African prince Oroonoko kills his lover Imoinda to save her from being violated by the English military forces against whom they are revolting. Oroonoko is later captured, bound to a post, quartered, and dismembered. Oroonoko, and its theatrical adaptation by Thomas Southerne, were received at the time as a great romance."
